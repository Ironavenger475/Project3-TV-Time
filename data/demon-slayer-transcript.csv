The weak have no rights or choices!
Their only fate is to be relentlessly crushed
by the strong! The demons might know how to cure your sister!

think that a demon would respect your will or wishes!
Naturally, I have no respect for you, either!

Why did you throw yourself over your sister
earlier? Was that your way of protecting her?
Why didn’t
you swing your hatchet? Why did you show your back to me?
All those blunders led to your sister’s capture!
I could have skewered
her along with you!

despair. Now’s not the time for that. (Thoughts) I know you’re
devastated.
Your family was massacred, and your sister’s
become a demon. (Thoughts) I know it’s painful. I
know you want to scream. I get it.
If only I’d gotten here a half-day
sooner, your family
might not have ended up dead.
But there’s no way to turn back time.

This girl has been wounded,
and she’s expending
energy to heal those
injuries.
She must’ve drained
vast amounts of her strength
as she transformed into a demon.
That means she’s
severely starved at this moment,

it.",Tanjirou,2,1,Thoughts," Back at the temple.

Huh…?,Tanjirou,2,1,," Back at the temple.
Tanjirou draws a small blade to kill the unconscious demon head.",1,,,,
"Ah…
Urokodaki        Too
slow!
You’re just too slow at making
decisions!
You failed to finish off that demon before daybreak!
Do you know why you couldn’t
answer my question
right away? It’s because your
resolve is too weak!
There are two things
to do if your sister devours a human.
Kill your sister! And slit your own belly and die!
That’s what it means to travel
with your sister who became
a demon! But that must never happen no matter what. And best you not forget.
Your sister,
taking the life of an innocent person…
That’s the one thing that must never happen. Ever!
Do you understand what I’m saying?",Tanjirou,2,1,," Back at the temple.
Tanjirou draws a small blade to kill the unconscious demon head.",1,,,,

"He’s so fast! Just how old is he anyway?! (Thoughts) And, like earlier,
I’m not hearing
any footsteps at all!
Nezuko,
I know it must be jarring, but please be patient!
Well, being patient
is all that you’ve ever known.
(Thoughts) Nezuko… all your life…
You’re
fixing your kimono again? I guess we’ll have to buy you a new one.",Tanjirou,2,1,Flashback," Back at the temple.

my favorite! (Flashback) I’d rather

do for the others… I’ll do it all for you!",Tanjirou,2,1,Thoughts," Back at the temple.

the test?

Urokodaki        Now, from here, go back down to the house at the foot of the mountain.
This time, I’m not going to wait until daybreak!",Tanjirou,2,1,," In the late afternoon. Tanjirou and Urokodaki have arrived at Urokodaki’s house.
Tanjirou is dead tired.",1,,,,
"What?
Is that all?
I see. He thinks I might get lost in this thick
fog. (Thoughts) I just have to get back by daybreak, right? (Thoughts)
That’s easy! I’ve got a great sense of smell!
I’ve already memorized Mr. Urokodaki’s scent!
Rocks?!
Ugh…
A pitfall!
I get it now. So there are traps all around!
(Thoughts) That’s the deal, huh?",Tanjirou,2,1,Thoughts," In the late afternoon. Tanjirou and Urokodaki have arrived at Urokodaki’s house.

Tanjirou is dead tired.",1,,,,
"Ugh…
Crap, crap, crap!
If I keep walking into traps like this, I won’t
make it down the mountain
by morning!
And besides, this mountain… This mountain is… (Thoughts) The air is thin here!
It’s way thinner here than on the mountain
where I used to live!
That’s
why I’m gasping
for air like this and feel so dizzy!",Tanjirou,2,1,Thoughts," In the late afternoon. Tanjirou and Urokodaki have arrived at Urokodaki’s house.
Tanjirou is dead tired.",1,,,,
Will I make it back? I might pass out! (Thoughts) No! I gotta make it back!,Tanjirou,2,1,Thoughts," In the late afternoon. Tanjirou and Urokodaki have arrived at Urokodaki’s house.
Tanjirou is dead tired.",1,,,,
"Get your breathing
under control… and sniff out each of those traps!",Tanjirou,2,1,Thoughts," In the late afternoon. Tanjirou and Urokodaki have arrived at Urokodaki’s house.
Tanjirou is dead tired.",1,,,,
"Right! I’ve got it! I’ve got it!
Traps set by human hands
have a slightly different scent after all!
But that doesn’t mean… I’m suddenly
athletic enough to dodge every one of them!
I’m gonna make it back no matter what! (Thoughts) Nezuko!",Tanjirou,2,1,Thoughts," In the late afternoon. Tanjirou and Urokodaki have arrived at Urokodaki’s house.
Tanjirou is dead tired.",1,,,,
I… have… returned…,Tanjirou,2,1,," At Urokodaki’s house. Urokodaki watches
over Nezuko as the sky is beginning
to become light. Tanjirou opens the sliding door.",1,,,,
"Forgive
my abruptness, Mr. Sakonji Urokodaki.
I’m sending a boy your way who wants to become a Demon Slayer swordsman.
He was brazen
enough to attack
me unarmed.
His family was slaughtered by a demon,
and the surviving younger sister has become one, but I have determined that
she will not attack humans.
I
can sense something different about these two. (Flashback) Like yourself, the boy seems
to have a keen sense
of smell.
Perhaps
he’ll find a way to break through
and become your heir apparent. (Flashback) I am asking you to
train him.
I realize that this
is a self-serving request, but please forgive
me. (Flashback) I hope that you will take good care of yourself
in your endeavors.
Yours truly, Giyuu Tomioka.
Urokodaki        I
accept you as my student,
Tanjirou Kamado.",Tomioka,2,1,Flashback," At Urokodaki’s house. Urokodaki watches
over Nezuko as the sky is beginning
to become light. Tanjirou opens the sliding door.",1,,,,
"Ngh!
Starting
today, I’m going to keep a journal
for Nezuko. (Narration) I’m
descending the mountain again today.
I’m going to train my hardest so I won’t
die during the Final Selection.
Ah! Urgh…!",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou trains.",1,,,,
"Ngh!
After repeatedly descending the mountain day after day, I’m starting
to learn how to avoid most of
the traps.
It’s because I’m much stronger
now, and because
I’m even more adept at detecting scents than before.
Even so… Ah!",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou trains.",1,,,,
"… the traps are getting
more and more difficult.
(Narration) He may really want to kill me!",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou trains.",1,,,,
"I made my descent today,
sword in hand,

my movement.

the day. Tanjirou
descends the mountain
again.",1,,,,

I can’t stop getting ensnared

the day. Tanjirou
descends the mountain
again.",1,,,,
"991! 992!
I swung the sword today.
Well, it’s not just today.
I’ve been swinging
the sword every
single day.
After descending the mountain, I swing my sword until my arms nearly fall off.
1,000!
Urokodaki        500
more!
Urokodaki        Swords break easily.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri during
the day. Tanjirou
descends the mountain
again.",1,,,,
"That’s what he told me beforehand.
Though it’s strong vertically, it’s weak horizontally. (Narration) You need to apply the force straight
along the blade.
The blade’s direction
and the direction in which you apply the force must be
exactly the same.
And he added,
“If you ever damage the blade, in other words, break it, I’ll
snap your bones, as well,” in a threatening voice.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri during the day. Urokodaki trains
Tanjirou on how to slice cleanly.",1,,,,
"Nezuko… I’ll keep working
hard, okay?",Tanjirou,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri during the day. Urokodaki trains
Tanjirou on how to slice cleanly.",1,,,,
Huh?,Tanjirou,3,1,," Some days later, on Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Urokodaki with his sword in hand.",1,,,,

Training to break my fall and get up quickly from any position. Argh!",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," Some days later, on Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Urokodaki with his sword in hand.",1,,,,
"I wield my sword, and I charge
Mr. Urokodaki, really
trying to kill
him.
In contrast, Mr. Urokodaki is bare-handed and unarmed.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," Some days later, on Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Urokodaki with his sword in hand.",1,,,,
"Huh?!
What?!
But he’s ridiculously powerful!
He flings me away to roll on the ground
every time.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," Some days later, on Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Urokodaki with his sword in hand.",1,,,,
"I’m home, Nezuko.",Tanjirou,3,1,," Some days later, on Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Urokodaki with his sword in hand.",1,,,,
"Today,
I learned breathing
techniques and some forms.
Total Concentration Breathing?
Urokodaki        That’s right. And I’m going to teach you all ten of the Water Breathing
forms.
Remember to take a long breath so the oxygen flows into every cell in your body.
This will enhance your body’s natural
healing power, and both stabilize and energize your spirit.
Relax your upper
body while bracing
your lower half. All right, breathe!
Urokodaki        Wrong!
Tanjirou        Agh…! Urokodaki      Next! Forms!",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri during
the day. Tanjirou

my stomach and am clobbered to a pulp.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri during
the day. Tanjirou

Urokodaki        Get
in there!

Ahhh!! Nezuko! I am water!,Tanjirou,3,1,, Tanjirou and Urokodaki stand on a cliff near a waterfall.,1,,,,
"And now it’s been six months since Nezuko was last awake.
Mr. Urokodaki summoned
the doctor right away and had him examine her, but
he found nothing wrong.
But it’s not normal for her to stay asleep
like this. (Narration) I was
scared.
I worry that one morning,
I’ll wake up to find her dead. (Narration) Not a day goes by that
I don’t worry.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration, Tanjirou and Urokodaki stand on a cliff near a waterfall.,1,,,,

where I train.
Ngh… Urgh… Agh!",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
continues his mountain
descent.",1,,,,
"Time and time again, I think I might die.
Urokodaki        I
have nothing more to teach you.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
continues his mountain
descent.",1,,,,
"A year after
I arrived at Mt. Sagiri,
he told me all of a sudden… Huh?
Urokodaki        The
rest is up to you!
Whether or not you can improve
to the next level. Come with
me!",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"Ah…
Urokodaki        If
you can slice this boulder,
I will allow you to enter the Final Selection.",Tanjirou,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"Ah…
Is a
boulder… something you slice? (Thoughts) Something you can slice
with a sword?
I don’t think
I can do it. My sword will snap!
Mr. Urokodaki, please wait!
Mr. Urokodaki!
After that,
Mr. Urokodaki never taught me anything again. Ngh…!",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"Argh!
Ah… Hah… Argh!",Tanjirou,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"Every
day, I practiced over and over what I’d learned
from Mr. Urokodaki.
The basics like holding the breath and flexibility… I was glad I had written
those down in my journal.
Argh!",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"But… even after six months
had passed, I still couldn’t
slice the boulder. (Narration) I felt frustrated.
Not enough!
I’m not training
hard enough!
I gotta do more! More!",Tanjirou,3,1,Thoughts," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"Am I… hopeless?
Is Nezuko going to die without ever waking up? (Thoughts) Ahh! I’ll almost give in!
I’m breaking down!",Tanjirou,3,1,Thoughts," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"Keep working, Tanjirou! You can do it!",Tanjirou,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.

Shut up!,Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"A man shouldn’t whine.
It’s unseemly.",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"When did he show up?
There’s
no scent. A fox mask?",Tanjirou,3,1,Thoughts," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"No matter how you suffer, bear it in silence… if you’re a man.",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"If you call yourself
a man.",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"Urk… Agh!
Urgh…",Tanjirou,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou catches his breath.",1,,,,
"Slow. Weak.
Immature.
That’s not what you call a man.",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.

What are you doing?,Tanjirou,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,

doing.",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.

What do you mean? I’m training.,Tanjirou,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
"How long do you plan to keep your butt on the ground
without even taking
a stance?
Ngh!",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.

Come on. Come at me.,Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.

So you think you’re actually going to injure me!",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
Ngh…!,Tanjirou,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
"Well, you have absolutely nothing to worry about!
I’m more powerful than you because
I’ve sliced that
boulder!",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
He sliced that boulder?,Tanjirou,3,1,Thoughts," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
"You’ve learned nothing.
You haven’t mastered a single thing!
Particularly, the breathing technique
Mr. Urokodaki taught
you… Total Concentration Breathing.
He knows Mr. Urokodaki? And the breathing
technique, too?",Sabito,3,1,Thoughts," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
"All you did was memorize it as fact.
Your body has no clue what it needs
to do.
What the hell were you doing for a whole year and a half?",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
Urgh…!,Tanjirou,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
Slam it into your flesh!,Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.

So that you’ll never forget the secrets Mr. Urokodaki taught
you! Pound it into the marrow of your bones!",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
"I’m trying!
I’m trying
every single day! With everything I’ve got! But I’m
not making any headway!
I just can’t go any further!",Tanjirou,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.

a man!",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.

"If you call yourself
a man!
There’s no other way to go but forward! Bring it on!
Show me what you’re capable
of!",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
"I’m leaving
the rest to you.",Sabito,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
Yeah.,Makomo,3,1,," On Mt. Sagiri.
Tanjirou faces Sabito.",1,,,,
Ngh… Ah… Makomo,Tanjirou,3,1,," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
Did you see that just now?,Tanjirou,3,1,," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"What a strike that was!
Not a single bit of wasted
motion! It was really beautiful!
I want to become
like that!
You think I can become like him?",Tanjirou,3,1,," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"Heh…
I’m sure you can… since I’ll be looking after you.
Hehe!",Makomo,3,1,," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"She’s so cute…
Who are you?
This
girl’s name was Makomo. (Narration) She told me the boy’s name was Sabito. (Narration) Makomo also pointed
out my defects.
She corrected my unnecessary movements
and bad habits.
But when
I asked her why she was doing that, and where she came from, she
didn’t tell me anything.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
Both he and I love Mr. Urokodaki very much.,Makomo,3,1,," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"That was Makomo’s
pet phrase. (Narration) She and Sabito
weren’t siblings.
She said Mr. Urokodaki raised
them after they’d
been orphaned.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"There are other children
besides us.
They’re always watching you, Tanjirou.",Makomo,3,1,," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"Makomo is a somewhat
strange girl. (Narration) She speaks
in such an abstract, dreamy way.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"See, Total Concentration Breathing
accelerates your blood circulation and your heart rate.
That causes your body temperature to spike, making
you as strong as a demon while staying human.
The most important thing is to expand your lung capacity.
When you bring lots of air into your blood, and when your blood gets excited, your bones
and muscles scurry to heat up and grow stronger.",Makomo,3,1,," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"I’m not sure I get
that.
How can I do that?",Tanjirou,3,1,Thoughts," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"Train to death.
At the end of the day, there’s nothing
else you can do.",Makomo,3,1,," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"Until
my arms and legs were ready to fall off…
Until my lungs and heart were ready
to burst, I swung my sword.
(Narration) But still… I just couldn’t beat Sabito.
Not until six months later.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," At night. Tanjirou
wakes up.",1,,,,
"When I challenged him that day, Sabito was wielding a real sword.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," Six months
later, on Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
and Sabito face each other.",1,,,,
"After six months, finally,
you have the look of a man.",Sabito,3,1,," Six months
later, on Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
and Sabito face each other.",1,,,,
"Today’s the day I win!
Head-on battles are simple. (Thoughts) Whoever’s
stronger and faster
wins.",Tanjirou,3,1,Thoughts," Six months
later, on Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
and Sabito face each other.",1,,,,
The battle was over in an instant.,Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," Six months
later, on Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
and Sabito face each other.",1,,,,
"On this day, in this moment, for the first time, my blade reached
Sabito first.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," Six months
later, on Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
and Sabito face each other.",1,,,,
"The moment I won, Sabito
smiled.
He looked sad and happy. A relieved
kind of smile.",Tanjirou,3,1,Narration," Six months
later, on Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
and Sabito face each other.",1,,,,
Tanjirou…,Makomo,3,1,," Six months
later, on Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
and Sabito face each other.",1,,,,
Ah…,Tanjirou,3,1,," Six months
later, on Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
and Sabito face each other.",1,,,,
"You did great. Don’t forget what you just
did.
Win, okay, Tanjirou?
Beat that guy, too.
The next thing I knew,
Sabito was gone… Ah…!
… and my sword, which I was sure had slashed Sabito’s
mask… had sliced the boulder.",Makomo,3,1,Narration," Six months
later, on Mt. Sagiri. Tanjirou
and Sabito face each other.",1,,,,
"The reason I won… was because I learned
to detect the scent of the opening thread.
When I’m battling
someone and I pick up this scent,
then I can see the thread.
The thread is connected from my blade to my opponent’s opening,
growing taut the instant I see it.
My blade is drawn toward
it with great force, and then I slash the opening.",Tanjirou,4,1,Narration,,,,,,
"Mr. Urokodaki…
Urokodaki        I
had no intention of sending
you to the Final Selection.
I didn’t want to see children
die anymore.
I was sure you wouldn’t be able to slice this boulder, but…
Urokodaki        Well done, my boy.
Tanjirou, you’re… a remarkable kid.
Urokodaki        Make sure you come back alive
from the Final
Selection.
Both your sister and I will be waiting
for you here.",Tanjirou,4,1,," In the forest. Tanjirou
has cut the boulder in half successfully. Urokodaki walks toward
him.",1,,,,
"Wow… What’s the occasion?
There’s so much.
Urokodaki        You’ve completed all your training, so we’re celebrating.
Don’t be shy. Eat up.
Urokodaki        (Thoughts) Tanjirou… there’s nothing
more I can do for you.
From here on out, you’ll
be going through
such hardship and strife. Your training will seem like nothing in
comparison.
So for now, at least,
you should rest well without
a care in the world.
Urokodaki        Hey, Tanjirou…",Tanjirou,4,1,Thoughts, At Urokodaki’s hut. Urokodaki is preparing dinner.,1,,,,
"Yes?
Urokodaki        Did
you enjoy that hot pot?",Tanjirou,4,1,, At Urokodaki’s hut. Urokodaki is preparing dinner.,1,,,,
"Yes! I haven’t had such a feast in so
long!
Urokodaki        A growing
boy like you with a hearty appetite
should get stronger
the more he eats, as well as grow bigger in size.
But that goes for demons, too.
Remember this. Basically, a demon is as strong
as the number of humans
he’s devoured.",Tanjirou,4,1,, At Urokodaki’s hut. Urokodaki is preparing dinner.,1,,,,
"So, the more they eat, the stronger they
get?
Urokodaki        That’s right.
There are demons
who gain power,
become able to transform their bodies,
and even use strange spells.
Urokodaki        When your sense of smell
becomes keener, you’ll be able to tell how many humans a
demon has consumed.",Tanjirou,4,1,, At Urokodaki’s hut. Urokodaki is preparing dinner.,1,,,,
"What’s this?
Urokodaki        It’s called a “warding
mask.”
I’ve charged it with a spell to protect
you from harm.",Tanjirou,4,1,, At Urokodaki’s hut. Urokodaki is preparing dinner.,1,,,,
A warding mask…,Tanjirou,4,1,, At Urokodaki’s hut. Urokodaki is preparing dinner.,1,,,,
Nezuko…,Tanjirou,4,1,," The next morning.
Tanjirou prepares for the Final Selection. Before
he leaves, he goes to the back room where Nezuko is sleeping.",1,,,,
"I’m coming back here no matter what, all right?
Urokodaki        Don’t worry about your sister. I’ll take good care of her.",Tanjirou,4,1,," The next morning.
Tanjirou prepares for the Final Selection. Before
he leaves, he goes to the back room where Nezuko is sleeping.",1,,,,
All right! Thank you very much!,Tanjirou,4,1,," The next morning.
Tanjirou prepares for the Final Selection. Before
he leaves, he goes to the back room where Nezuko is sleeping.",1,,,,
"I’ll be going, then, Mr. Urokodaki!",Tanjirou,4,1,," The next morning.
Tanjirou prepares for the Final Selection. Before

"Say hello to Sabito
and Makomo for me!
Urokodaki        What?
Tanjirou… how do you… know the names of those dead children?",Tanjirou,4,1,," The next morning.
Tanjirou prepares for the Final Selection. Before
he leaves, he goes to the back room where Nezuko is sleeping.",1,,,,
"Wow… Look at all these
wisteria flowers. Even though they’re
out of season…
There are so many.
Everyone. We thank you for coming
here tonight to the Demon
Slayers Corps Final Selection.",Tanjirou,4,1,Thoughts," At night.
Tanjirou walks on a path through wisteria
flowers.",1,,,,
"There are demons imprisoned here on Mt. Fujikasane, captured
alive by the Demon
Slayer swordsmen, and unable to leave.",Kanata,4,1,," At night.
Tanjirou walks on a path through wisteria
flowers.",1,,,,
"That is because wisteria, which demons hate so much, blooms year-round from the bottom to
halfway up the mountain.",Kiriya,4,1,," At night.
Tanjirou walks on a path through wisteria
flowers.",1,,,,
"However, there is no wisteria from this point
on, and so demons abound.",Kanata,4,1,," At night.
Tanjirou walks on a path through wisteria
flowers.",1,,,,
"You need to survive
here for seven days to pass the Final Selection.
And now, be on your way.",Kiriya,4,1,," At night.
Tanjirou walks on a path through wisteria
flowers.",1,,,,
"Survive for seven days… That’s
all I’m going to think about.",Tanjirou,4,1,Thoughts, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
"First, I’m going to survive
tonight.
Once the sun comes up, the demons won’t
be able to do anything, so I can get some rest
then.
So I’ll have to head east!
I’m gonna make my way to where the sunlight
will hit first!",Tanjirou,4,1,Thoughts, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
"This smell… It’s a demon!
And it’s nearby!",Tanjirou,4,1,Thoughts, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
Total Concentration! Water Breathing!,Tanjirou,4,1,Thoughts, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
"The scent of the thread!
Fourth Form! Striking
Tide!",Tanjirou,4,1,Thoughts, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
"I did it… I defeated demons! I’ve grown stronger! (Thoughts) All that training
wasn’t for nothing…
I’ve mastered it!
If I slash a demon with the sword Mr. Urokodaki gave
me,
Urokodaki        (Flashback) A demon’s weak spot is its neck!
But you can’t kill it with a normal sword
even if you slash its
neck.",Tanjirou,4,1,Flashback, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
"Then, how can I take it down?
Urokodaki        (Flashback) The swords wielded
by the Demon Slayer Corps were forged
with a special kind of steel. That’s the only way to kill a demon.
They’re
called the “Nichirin
Swords.”",Tanjirou,4,1,Flashback, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
Rest in peace.,Tanjirou,4,1,Thoughts, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
What’s this rotten smell?,Tanjirou,4,1,, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
No one ever told me! I never signed up for this!,Boy,4,1,, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
What’s going on?,Tanjirou,4,1,Thoughts, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
What the hell is that?!,Tanjirou,4,1,Thoughts, Tanjirou runs through the forest by himself.,1,,,,
"Hey, Sabito… Do you think Tanjirou
can beat that
one?",Makomo,4,1,," In the forest where
Tanjirou trained with Urokodaki.",1,,,,
"I don’t know.
No matter
how hard you try, it’s never enough. You know that well yourself, don’t
you?",Sabito,4,1,," In the forest where
Tanjirou trained with Urokodaki.",1,,,,

live long because
they’re killed during
the Final Selection, and they even eat
their own kind!
Hand Oni         Yeah, but I’ve survived

Hand Oni         The number
of Urokodaki’s disciples I’ve eaten, that’s
what.
I promised myself to kill every
one of his disciples.
Hand Oni         Let’s see… The ones who particularly stand out to me… It’s those two.
Those two… That brat’s
hair was an unusual color.
He was the most powerful. A scar by his mouth.
The other one was a female
brat in a flowery kimono.

"Wha…?
They had already
been killed by this demon?
But I was with them!
Hand Oni         That mask.
I can tell by the fox masks.
I know the texture
of the masks Urokodaki carved. The same style of carving he used for his own goblin mask.
Warding masks, right?
Everyone got eaten just because they were wearing them. They’re all here inside
my belly. Urokodaki might as well have killed
them himself! When I said that
to the girl, she was crying and fell into a rage.

Urgh… Ugh…!,Girl,8,1,," Elsewhere in Asakusa. Muzan
has left the scene with Rei and the daughter.",1,,,,
The human body is unable to withstand the speed of transformation.,Muzan,8,1,," Elsewhere in Asakusa. Muzan
has left the scene with Rei and the daughter.",1,,,,
… and its cells are destroyed.,Muzan,8,1,," Elsewhere in Asakusa. Muzan
has left the scene with Rei and the daughter.",1,,,,
"Bring me the head of the Demon Slayer who wears hanafuda-like earrings.
Understood?",Muzan,8,1,," Elsewhere in Asakusa. Muzan
has left the scene with Rei and the daughter.",1,,,,
"As you wish.
Susamaru        Your wish is our command.",Yahaba,8,1,," Elsewhere in Asakusa. Muzan
has left the scene with Rei and the daughter.",1,,,,
Those earrings…,Muzan,8,1,," Elsewhere in Asakusa. Muzan
has left the scene with Rei and the daughter.",1,,,,
"Now, listen to
me!
Here’s the deal…
My point is this, okay? It’s not about the money! What I can’t forgive
is your lack of intent
to eat my udon, all
right?!",Chef,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
I’m so sorry! Please serve me another bowl!,Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
So you’re gonna eat it?!,Chef,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
Yes!,Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
You’re definitely gonna eat it?,Chef,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
"Yes, I shall!
You, too! If you’re
gonna have udon, take off that bamboo
thingy first! What is that
thing anyway?!
Take these chopsticks! Chopsticks!",Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
"I’d like a bowl of udon! I’d like two bowls
of udon!",Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
R-Right…,Chef,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
"Thank you very much for the meal! That was
delicious!",Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
"As long as you get it! It’s all
good!
Thanks for your business!",Chef,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
"Sorry about that, Nezuko.
Leaving you behind
like that…",Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
"Woah… What’s wrong, Nezuko?",Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
"Sure, we’ll go, but still!
No way is she an
eyesore! Not on your life! Take a look at her where there’s a bit more light!
Come on, let’s go over there!",Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou is back at the udon cart. The chef is yelling at him.",1,,,,
"Oh, I know what it is! It’s this muzzle, right?!
It might be because
of this muzzle!
I’d like you to behold Nezuko without the muzzle!",Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
Welcome back.,Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"I’m sorry that I left
you to take care of things just now.
How is the lady?",Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"She'll be just fine.
Unfortunately, I have to keep her husband restrained in the basement.",Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
Sorry.,Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
I don’t think that’s gonna happen!,Tanjirou,8,1,Thoughts," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"It’s not that unbearable, you know.",Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"I believe it’s much easier for me than for normal
demons.
Because I’ve tweaked
my body considerably. I’ve also removed Kibutsuji’s curse.",Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
Curse? T-Tweaked your body?,Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
Come this way.,Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"Hey, Nezuko, that’s bad manners!",Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"That’s quite all right.
Please make yourselves at home.",Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"Now then,
allow me to continue. I adjusted our bodies so that we can live without
devouring humans.
A small amount of human blood is all we need.",Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
Blood? You mean…,Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"You may find it distasteful, but what I do is buy blood under the guise of transfusions from those unable to make ends meet.
Of course, no more than would
impair them.",Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"I see.
So that’s why I’m not picking up that strange
scent unique to demons
from these two.
But they do need human blood
after all. (Thoughts) If blood is all they need, then Nezuko…",Tanjirou,8,1,Thoughts," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"Yushirou can get by with even less blood.
I’m the one who turned him into a
demon.",Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"Huh? You did that?
But… Huh?",Tanjirou,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"You’re right. It’s generally
held that no one but Kibutsuji can reproduce demons.
That’s more or less accurate.
After more than 200 years, I was only able to transform Yushirou
into a demon after all.",Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"There’s one thing I’d like to clear up with you.
I’m not trying to create more
demons.
I only perform the procedure on the terminally ill or those so gravely
injured that they don’t have long left to live.
And in those cases,
I always ask them beforehand if they wish to live on even as
demons.",Tamayo,8,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"The scent she’s giving off is pure and devoid of deception. (Thoughts) She’s someone I can
trust.
Miss Tamayo, is there
a way to return a transformed demon
back to human
form?
Susamaru        See
anything?",Tanjirou,8,1,Thoughts," Sometime later.
Tanjirou, Nezuko, and Yushirou arrive
at Tamayo’s hiding place.",1,,,,
"I can see. I can see footprints.
This is it. This is it.",Yahaba,8,1,," Elsewhere, on a darkened
street. Susamaru and Yahaba are searching for Tanjirou. Yahaba gets on his knees and searches the
ground.",1,,,,
"Make a huge turn over there.
There are three of them.
And one’s carrying some kind of big box.
Susamaru        How
should we kill them, I wonder.
Fufufu… I can
feel the flow of power. Because of all the blood he shared with me.",Yahaba,8,1,," Elsewhere, on a darkened
street. Susamaru and Yahaba are searching for Tanjirou. Yahaba gets on his knees and searches the
ground.",1,,,,
"Of course we’re going
to slay them
vindictively.",Yahaba,8,1,," Elsewhere, on a darkened
street. Susamaru and Yahaba are searching for Tanjirou. Yahaba gets on his knees and searches the
ground.",1,,,,
"There is a way to turn a demon…
back into a human.",Tamayo,8,1,," At Tamayo’s
house. Tamayo, Yushirou,
Tanjirou, and Nezuko converse in the tatami
room.",1,,,,
Gahh!,Tanjirou,8,1,," At Tamayo’s
house. Tamayo, Yushirou,
Tanjirou, and Nezuko converse in the tatami
room.",1,,,,
"Ouch, ouch, ouch…
Please tell me how.",Tanjirou,8,1,," At Tamayo’s
house. Tamayo, Yushirou,
Tanjirou, and Nezuko converse in the tatami
room.",1,,,,
"For any kind of wound, there’s
always some kind of medicine
or treatment.
At this time, I’m unable to turn a demon back into a human, but surely, that,
too…",Tamayo,8,1,," At Tamayo’s
house. Tamayo, Yushirou,
Tanjirou, and Nezuko converse in the tatami
room.",1,,,,
"And yet, surprisingly, Nezuko
shows none of those signs.
This miracle will be the key to finding
a solution.",Tamayo,8,1,," At Tamayo’s
house. Tamayo, Yushirou,
Tanjirou, and Nezuko converse in the tatami
room.",1,,,,
Mm…,Nezuko,8,1,," At Tamayo’s
house. Tamayo, Yushirou,
Tanjirou, and Nezuko converse in the tatami
room.",1,,,,
"The other request I have for you is a harsh
one.
By “demons
closely related to Kibutsuji”, I mean demons whose powers
are more on par
with that of Kibutsuji himself.
It won’t be easy to extract blood from such demons.
Are you still willing to go along with my requests?",Tamayo,8,1,," At Tamayo’s
house. Tamayo, Yushirou,
Tanjirou, and Nezuko converse in the tatami
room.",1,,,,
"Fufufu… Did you decide
how to kill them?
Susamaru        Vindictively, of course!
Susamaru        Hehehe!",Yahaba,8,1,," At Tamayo’s
house. Tamayo, Yushirou,
Tanjirou, and Nezuko converse in the tatami
room.",1,,,,
Kuh!,Tanjirou,8,1,," At Tamayo’s
house. Tamayo, Yushirou,
Tanjirou, and Nezuko converse in the tatami

"Fufufufu… Did you decide
how to kill them?
Susamaru        Brutally, of course!
Susamaru        Hehehe!",Yahaba,9,1,," Near Tamayo’s
mansion. Susamaru and Yahaba arrive.",1,,,,
"Ngh… Kuh!
Susamaru        Hahaha! You were spot on, Yahaba!
A building just appeared
out of thin air!",Tanjirou,9,1,," Near Tamayo’s
mansion. Susamaru and Yahaba arrive.",1,,,,
"Yes. The handiwork of a demon
that’s adept at hiding objects.
And is the demon hunter accompanied by a demon? What’s going on here?
Susamaru        Hahahaha! Isn’t this fun?",Yahaba,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Still, I have to point this out, Susamaru… Your way of doing things is too immature. It’s too careless.
You covered me! My kimono is all covered
in dirt now! Tsk…
Susamaru        Oh, stop whining! We managed to find them right away thanks to my temari, so who cares?
And now we can have lots of fun!",Yahaba,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Tsk… You’ve gone and covered me in dirt again!
Susamaru        You’re so uptight. Your kimono isn’t the least
bit soiled.
And besides… Hahaha! There they are!",Yahaba,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Yushirou!! Dammit!
Nezuko! Take the lady sleeping
in the back somewhere safe outside!",Tanjirou,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"It’s too dangerous outside!
We have a basement, so take her there!",Tamayo,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
Understood!,Tanjirou,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Mm!
Susamaru        Hahaha! That’s one out for the
count!",Nezuko,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"She’s giving off a totally
different scent from any of the other
demons!
Is it
stronger? It has a really thick scent! It feels so heavy once it
enters my lungs!
Susamaru        Hm?
The demon hunter
wearing hanafuda earrings… That’d be you, huh?
I’m the one they’re targeting?
Miss Tamayo! Please find a safe place to hide! I’m the one they’re after!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Tanjirou, please don’t worry
about us. We’ll be fine without your protection.
We’re demons, after all.
Susamaru        All
right… It’s all over for you now!",Tamayo,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
That temari will only veer if I try to dodge it.,Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Kuh…!
Of the ten forms, the fastest thrusting
technique is… (Thoughts)
Total Concentration! Water Breathing!
Seventh Form!
Droplet Ripple Thrust
Curve!
Susamaru        (Thoughts) Oh, so your plan is to thrust
at the curve diagonally to soften the temari’s
blow?
However…
Ngh… How can
that temari move around like that? (Thoughts) It swerved unnaturally when it struck
Yashirou, too!
It’s not like it has any natural
spin to it, and yet… What’s going
on?",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
Twelve Blood Moons?,Tanjirou,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"They serve directly under Kibutsuji!
Susamaru        Hahahaha!",Tamayo,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"If I were to cast my Blood Arts now, it would
affect Tanjirou as well.
(Thoughts) And Yushirou needs time to prepare before he can attack.
But if this goes on…",Tamayo,9,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"There it is again! They changed trajectory again, even without
hitting anything!
Even if I cut them and they lose force, they still end up hitting
me anyway! Ugh… Ngh…!
I can smell
two different scents of blood.
That means there
are two demons!
I can locate them with their scent! But…",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
Miss Tamayo! Yushirou!,Tanjirou,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Kuh…
I can’t… I don’t have time to protect them!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"I can see them now! She was using those
arrows to control…
the trajectory of the temari!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
Mm.,Nezuko,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"I’m your target!
Susamaru        The
demon hunter wearing
hanafuda earrings…
No question about it. I’m going to bring your head to our
lord!",Tanjirou,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Kuh…!
Susamaru        Hahahaha! This is fun!",Tanjirou,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Nezuko, how much longer will it take?",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
Hm?,Yahaba,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,

mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Water Breathing!
Haah!
Third Form! Flowing
Dance!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Miss Tamayo! Do these two demons
have high concentrations of Kibutsuji’s blood?",Tanjirou,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
Most likely.,Tamayo,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
In that case… I’m going to be extracting their blood!,Tanjirou,9,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. The temari
balls once again return to Susamaru.",1,,,,
"I have two favors to ask of you.
One, permission to study your sister’s blood.
Two, to retrieve
as many blood
samples from demons
with a high concentration of Kibutsuji’s blood as you can.
A demon with a high concentration of Kibutsuji’s blood means a demon close in strength to Kibutsuji himself.
It won’t be easy to extract blood from such demons.",Tamayo,9,1,Flashback," In the past, at Tamayo’s mansion.
Tamayo, Yushirou, Tanjirou, and Nezuko are gathered.",1,,,,
"Gah! Tsk…
Don’t stir up dirt like that.
So filthy!
Susamaru        Hahahaha!",Yahaba,9,1,," In the trees. Nezuko
makes her assault
on Yahaba.",1,,,,
"She grew new arms in such a short time!
She can regenerate way faster than the demons I fought
during the Final Selection!
Susamaru        I’m
going to bring him that head of yours.",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
Ah…! Nezuko!,Tanjirou,9,1,," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,

Susamaru        Now
then, why don’t you two die together?",Yahaba,9,1,," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,

faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
I’m counting on you.,Tanjirou,9,1,," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
"I swear… I’m going to extract their
blood!
If it means the medicine
will be perfected even a minute sooner,
I’ll gladly face any demon!
I’ll fight and win!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
"There it is! The opening
thread!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Tsk… What a grimy little imp you are.
Stay away from me!",Yahaba,9,1,," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
The thread snapped!,Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
Ugh… Ngh…!,Tanjirou,9,1,," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
"This hurts! I mean this really… It seriously hurts!
A form! I need to lighten the impact with one of my forms! (Thoughts) Eighth Form! Waterfall
Basin!
Susamaru        Hahaha!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
"You mustn’t kick it!
Susamaru        Hahahaha!
Susamaru        This is fun! I’m having so much fun!
Kickball sure is fun.
Yahaba! You think four heads will be enough
to take home?",Tamayo,9,1,," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
"No. We’re taking just two. The demon hunter
and the fugitive.
We have no use for the other two.",Yahaba,9,1,," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
"Kuh…!
The bleeding
isn’t stopping instantly. She recovers so slowly.
This medicine will help heal your leg right away, all right?",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," On the ground. Tanjirou
faces Susamaru.",1,,,,
"What should I do? I can’t afford
to lose!
But even if I can see the opening thread,
tracing it will be difficult!
Any move would
be pointless… unless
I can land my blow with pinpoint accuracy!
If I’m off by even a little,
it won’t be strong enough to take him down! (Thoughts) He’ll just change the
blade’s direction using his arrow skills!
And I hate to say it,
but those eyeballs are really
creepy! Though I hate to say
it!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," Outside in the garden.
Tanjirou faces off against Yahaba.",1,,,,
Hmph! Hahahaha!,Yahaba,9,1,," Outside in the garden.
Tanjirou faces off against Yahaba.",1,,,,

And they won’t disappear until they hit me! I can’t cut them with my sword, either!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," Outside in the garden.

them, I’ll get blasted in the arrow’s
direction!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," Outside in the garden.

"Everything is going in the direction
I want it to!
Your arm’s gonna get twisted right off!",Yahaba,9,1,," Outside in the garden.
Tanjirou faces off against Yahaba.",1,,,,
"You eluded it by spinning
in the same direction as the Pure Crimson Arrow? (Thoughts) Damn monkey!
I can’t take much more of his attacks! I’ve gotta strike
back! (Thoughts) I’ve gotta change the arrow’s direction without touching it directly!",Yahaba,9,1,Thoughts," Outside in the garden.
Tanjirou faces off against Yahaba.",1,,,,
Tsk… It’s about time to die!,Yahaba,9,1,," Outside in the garden.
Tanjirou faces off against Yahaba.",1,,,,
"Adapt your movement!
First, use the Sixth Form to envelop
the arrow!
Then use the footwork of the Third
Form… to close
in on him!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," Outside in the garden.

"Haaa!!
Twist! Envelop! (Thoughts)
Flowing Maelstrom Spin!",Tanjirou,9,1,Thoughts," Outside in the garden.

My sword’s so heavy! But…!
Second Form… Improved… Lateral Water Wheel!",Tanjirou,10,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. Tanjirou faces
off against Yahaba.",1,,,,
"Ugh…!
I did it! The Whirlpool move loses force when it’s not underwater!
But thanks
to my opponent’s attack, it gained
power, and I was able to envelop the arrows!
Curse you! Curse you! Curse you! All I had to do was bring back your head, and I would’ve won his approval!
I’ll never
forgive you! I’ll never forgive
you! Shoving my face into this vile dirt!
You’re going down with me!
Oh no! He’s gonna get me!
I’m getting pulled by a force stronger
than the arrows
he’s hit me with!
I gotta
unleash move after move and go on the defensive, or my body’s
going to get smashed!
Fourth form! Striking Tide!
The pressure
is bearing down on my body, and I can’t swing my sword!
(Thoughts) Unleash one! Unleash a move! Not here! Don’t let yourself get beat!
Second Form, Water Wheel!
Waterfall Basin!
Water Surface
Slash! Drop Ripple Thrust Curve!
Whirlpool!
I’ve never made this many consecutive moves before!

"How many more times? How many?
Don’t
think about it! Just keep unleashing moves!
Keep throwing them
out!",Tanjirou,10,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s

yet!",Yahaba,10,1,," At Tamayo’s

Susamaru        Hahahaha!",Nezuko,10,1,," Elsewhere on the property. Yushirou faces off against Susamaru. Susamaru bounces her temari

"It doesn’t make one physically stronger. What we’re seeing
is Nezuko’s own power.
Without devouring human
blood, solely on her own… Nezuko is gaining strength at a rapid
rate.
Susamaru        Ah…",Tamayo,10,1,," Elsewhere on the property. Yushirou faces off against Susamaru. Susamaru bounces her temari
balls, causing dust to be stirred up.",1,,,,
"However, her opponent is also formidable. If she were to go all-out, Nezuko wouldn’t stand a chance.
I’ve got to… do something.
Susamaru        Hahahaha! You’re
an amusing little girl!
This time, I’m going
all-out against you! I wonder how long you can hold out!",Tamayo,10,1,Thoughts," Elsewhere on the property. Yushirou faces off against Susamaru. Susamaru bounces her temari
balls, causing dust to be stirred up.",1,,,,

balls, causing dust to be stirred up.",1,,,,
"Just tell me one thing please.
Are you aware of Kibutsuji’s true identity?
Susamaru        Ah…!
What the hell did you say?!",Tamayo,10,1,," Elsewhere on the property. Yushirou faces off against Susamaru. Susamaru bounces her temari
balls, causing dust to be stirred up.",1,,,,
"That man is nothing
but a coward. He lives in constant
fear of something.
Susamaru        Stop it! Damn you! Stop it!",Tamayo,10,1,," Elsewhere on the property. Yushirou faces off against Susamaru. Susamaru bounces her temari
balls, causing dust to be stirred up.",1,,,,
Did she just die?,Tanjirou,10,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. Susamaru has been subjected
to Kibutsuji’s curse.",1,,,,
"She will die momentarily.
That’s the curse. Her physical body will be destroyed by Kibutsuji’s cells
still in her body.",Tamayo,10,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. Susamaru has been subjected
to Kibutsuji’s curse.",1,,,,
"Tanjirou… She is not one of the Twelve
Kizuki.
The Twelve
Kizuki have numbers
engraved on their eyeballs, but this demon doesn’t
have one.
Most likely,
the other demon isn’t a member of the Twelve Kizuki, either.
They’re too weak.",Tamayo,10,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. Susamaru has been subjected
to Kibutsuji’s curse.",1,,,,
"Here’s your mari.
Susamaru        Play with me. Play with me.",Tanjirou,10,1,," At Tamayo’s
mansion. Susamaru has been subjected
to Kibutsuji’s curse.",1,,,,
"You’re just like a little
kid. Even though
you must’ve murdered
scores of people.",Tanjirou,10,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. Susamaru has been subjected
to Kibutsuji’s curse.",1,,,,
"You were deluded into thinking
you were in the Twelve
Kizuki. Deceived… Compelled to
fight… And now, you were killed by the Kibutsuji curse.
There’s
no salvation.
Even after you die, not even your bones will remain.
(Thoughts) Is this the price you pay for killing others?
Kibutsuji… This is how that man treats even those who revere him! (Thoughts) He’s a true… demon!",Tanjirou,10,1,Thoughts," At Tamayo’s
mansion. Susamaru has been subjected
to Kibutsuji’s curse.",1,,,,
"Hurry down, then, Tanjirou!",Tamayo,10,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,

"Nezuko has been acting
this way since she awoke.
Do you think she’s all right?",Tamayo,10,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,
"But Nezuko has perceived you two as humans. That’s
why she tried to protect
you.",Tanjirou,10,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,
Ahh…,Tamayo,10,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,
"At first,
I didn’t like the idea of Nezuko
being under a spell, but since it looks like she has a will of her own, I’m glad that --",Tanjirou,10,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,
"Ah…! I-I’m so sorry!
Nezuko! Nezuko! S-Step away from her! It’s rude, all right?!",Tanjirou,10,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,
"Do you still
wish to live?
Do you still wish to live even if you’re no longer
human?
If this goes on, you will most likely succumb
to your illness.
However, losing your humanity
will cause you pain and grief.
Do you still wish to live? Yushirou and I will leave this
region.",Tamayo,10,1,Flashback," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,
"We’ve gotten too close to Kibutsuji. We must conceal
our whereabouts soon or the risk
will be too great.
Not to mention, even if I think I’ve concealed my identity, when I interact
with humans as a doctor, people sometimes see through
my disguise as a demon.
The young and the elderly
are particularly perceptive. Tanjirou…",Tamayo,10,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,
Yes?,Tanjirou,10,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,
"I can’t give you an absolute
guarantee that she’ll
be safe, but I believe
it will be less
dangerous than taking her into battle.",Tamayo,10,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,
"That might be true. She’s right. It would be better for Nezuko to be in their
care.",Tanjirou,10,1,Thoughts," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,
Ah… Ahh…,Tanjirou,10,1,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou walks into Tamayo’s mansion.",1,,,,

But… Nezuko
and I are staying together.
We’re not going to live apart from each other. Never again.",Tanjirou,10,1,," Sometime later.

Okay, Miss Tamayo, Yushirou, we wish you
well!",Tanjirou,10,1,," Sometime later.

get to e-eat me.
A-And then, the one with the drum growing
out of him… When the other monster defeated him, he dropped a drum!

Miss Tamayo may have treated
my wounds, but I haven’t
fully recovered from my injuries yet!
Can I beat him? These injuries hurt so badly that I can hardly stand it!
All this time, I’ve just been
enduring it! When I
pulled Zenitsu off that girl and when I started out, I was enduring
this horrendous pain!

it because I’m the eldest

are making me imagine the most awful things!

want to cry. So kind, I don’t think I’ve ever heard anything like it before.

Breathing, heartbeats, the sound
of blood circulating… By listening closely,
I could tell what someone was thinking.
But I’ve been deceived by others time and time again. I’ve always believed
in whomever I wanted to believe in.
Tanjirou,

is travelling with a demon.

for that.

to protect somebody and make
that person happy, just once in my life.
Not even a simple future
like that. There’s
no one who hopes that I’ll have one.
If you fail, cry,
and run away even once, they say, “Oh, this guy’s no good,”
and they walk away.

back. Clearly, he did smack me around a bit too much. But he never abandoned

me, all the time he spent on me… It wasn’t for nothing!

moved.
Seeing the bond you two share gave me chills.

But now the only thing left for you is death by my hand.
It would be sad if it were to come to pass, right?
But there’s
just one thing. Just one thing that will let you escape

I’ll teach her what
will happen if she defies me.",Rui,19,1,," At Tanjirou’s location. Tanjirou prepares
to fight Rui with his broken sword.",1,,,,
"I’ve had enough of this crazy talk!
Using terror

"Family.
A father has his role as the father,
and the mother has her role as the mother.
The parents
protect the children, and the elder brother and sister protect
their younger siblings.
No matter what. At the risk of their own lives.
The way I
see it, if you don’t understand your own role, there’s no reason for you to live.
What about you? What is your role?
Your role is to relinquish your younger sister
to me and disappear. If you
can’t do that, your only
option is to die.
Because you can’t defeat me.",Rui,19,1,," In the forest

not enough to kill her. After all, she’s a demon.
But it looks like I’ll have to teach her a lesson after all. I’m going to let her bleed for a

can Father dance like that in the snow for so long when he’s so frail?

yourself, no matter how much
you move.
Y.Tanjirou        Breathe?
Tanjuurou        Right. If you can master the correct way to breathe,
you’ll be able to dance forever, too.

fact is that Nezuko has refrained from devouring humans for more than two

after Tanjirou. Though
his purpose may simply be to silence him, now that Kibutsuji’s given
himself away for the first time, I don’t want to let go.

that Kibutsuji never
saw coming.",Kagaya,22,1,," At the Demon Slayer
Corps headquarters. Kagaya
has arrived.",1,,,,
"Can you try to understand?
Shinazugawa     No, I can’t understand, Master.
If it were
human, I’d be okay with letting it live, but not a demon! Not after all that we

"Nezuko… Thanks for protecting me on the mountain.
Who would’ve
guessed that not only you, but Mr. Urokodaki and Mr. Tomioka,
as well… They’re all risking
their lives for us. They’re all taking care of us.
I need to… become stronger.
Even today…
the Master more or less saved both your life and mine. That man’s voice… It was so soothing
in a mysterious way.
Just listening to him speak made my head feel light. I wonder what kind of person he is.
Oh, right. You’re sleep-deprived, aren’t you?
I’m hurting, and this is rough,
but I gotta keep on fighting. Because… I’ll be a grown man one day.
And then, I’ll become
an old guy and die. And then, the demon Nezuko will end up all
alone.
That would be too lonely, wouldn’t
it, Nezuko?
I promise you I’ll turn you back into a human,
okay?",Tanjirou,23,1,," In the late evening. Tanjirou
places Nezuko’s box on the ground and closes the curtains.",1,,,,
"Just as you’ve all reported, the demons’ carnage
has increased more than ever.
The threat to human
life is greater
than it’s ever been.
We’ll have to bolster
the ranks of the Demon
Slayers. What do you all think?
Shinazugawa    The incident on Mt. Natagumo
made it crystal clear.
The caliber
of Demon Slayers
has nose-dived to unbelievable levels.
Most of them are
useless.
The trainers must be blind.
You’d think they could at least
tell if someone’s competent or not.",Kagaya,23,1,," In a room in the Demon Slayer
Corps Headquarters. The Hashiras are gathered with Kagaya.",1,,,,

sure seemed competent.

population increases, the harder it becomes to control and unify
them.

"Other than those who’ve had their loved ones brutally massacred
and joined the Corps,
or those of distinguished pedigree who have hunted demons for generations, to
ask anyone to harness as much or even greater resolve and drive to produce results would be cruel.",Himejima,23,1,," In a room in the Demon Slayer
Corps Headquarters. The Hashiras are gathered with Kagaya.",1,,,,
"Still,
considering that boy ran into a Twelve Kizuki so soon after joining the Corps… He may have the power to draw them! Even
we rarely get the chance to confront one! It makes me envious!",Rengoku,23,1,," In a room in the Demon Slayer
Corps Headquarters. The Hashiras are gathered with Kagaya.",1,,,,
"Agreed. But the fact that Lower
Five made such a drastic
move probably means that
Muzan is nowhere near Mt. Natagumo.
After all, as in the case of Asakusa,
whenever Muzan wishes
to hide something, he creates a clever diversion to throw us off.
It’s really quite frustrating.
But those demons are still freely
devouring humans, gaining
strength and surviving. For the sake of those who have died, there is only one thing for
us to do.
I believe that among you Hashiras who are present
today, I’ve assembled
the finest unit since the First Breathing swordsmen
of the feudal era.
Tengen Uzui,
Kyoujurou Rengoku, Shinobu Kochou, Mitsuri Kanroji, Muichirou Tokitou, Gyoumei Himejima,
Sanemi Shinazugawa, Obanai Iguro, Giyuu Tomioka… My children,
I look forward to your success.",Kagaya,23,1,," In a room in the Demon Slayer

was summoned to the Hashira
Meeting to give my report on
the Mt. Natagumo incident, but it was like hell! Those
Hashiras are way too terrifying!
All pissed about
how the quality of the newer Slayers

because there were some of us
who didn’t follow orders on Mt. Natagumo. And they were like, “Who trained
them?”

of my rank, anyway? Ugh…",Murata,24,1,, In the hospital room. Murata sits down near Tanjirou’s bed.,1,,,,

"Tanjirou and Inosuke were taken
away by the Hashira, Lady Kochou, and started something called
“Rehabilitation Training”.
Lady Shinobu’s voice is totally
unique. I don’t think I’ve ever heard anything
like it.
It lacks regularity, and it scares
me a little.
But when she was treating
the people who got turned
into spiders, she sure
seemed like a goddess. No wonder everyone ran to Lady Shinobu in tears.
Not only that, but she’s unbelievably cute! I bet she could
make a living on her looks alone.
So, this cute lady has taken Tanjirou and Inosuke to Rehabilitation Training
to rebuild their stamina. And

Apologize to me! How dare you act like you’d

Get down on your hands and knees and apologize! Commit
ritualistic suicide!",Zenitsu,24,1,," Outside the butterfly manor.

"You’re allowed
to touch girls! You get to have your bodies
massaged! When you play that cup game, you get to touch their
hands! When you play tag, you get to touch their whole freakin’ bodies!

by, and it’s mad fun just to look at them!
Ahhh!! Heaven! Sheer heaven!",Zenitsu,24,1,," Outside the butterfly manor.
Zenitsu yells at Tanjirou and Inosuke.",1,,,,

"For the next five days, I continued
to lose to Kanao.
So
did Inosuke… and Zenitsu. We couldn’t so much as lay a finger on a strand of her hair. And then one day, the other two stopped

Z-Zenitsu?
Inosuke? Ahh… Please train me!",Tanjirou,24,1,Narration," Sometime

"Why can’t I beat her? What gives her the edge over me?
First of all,
her reflexes are way faster.
Even if I were at 100 percent,
I’d probably lose to her.
Her scent is totally different. It’s similar to the scent
of the Hashiras.",Tanjirou,24,1,Thoughts," At night,

the Total Concentration Breathing state around
the clock?",Kiyo,24,1,," At night,

that.
Is that even possible?",Tanjirou,24,1,," At night,

takes its toll on me, but I should
do it around the clock, huh?",Tanjirou,24,1,," At night,

"Isn’t it about time you came to training,
Inosuke?
Sulking and feeling sorry for yourself
won’t do you any good. Zenitsu, you should come, too!",Tanjirou,24,1,," At the Butterfly Manor. Zenitsu sits on his bed and Inosuke lies in his while Tanjirou
prepares to go out.",1,,,,

"Total
Concentration Breathing. Morning,
noon, and night.
Even while I’m asleep, I said I’d try to keep it up
around the clock, but…
… I can’t do it at all! I can’t do it!
If I try to do Total Concentration Breathing longer, it makes me feel like I’m gonna die!
It’s too painful! My lungs hurt! My ears hurt! My ears are ringing
like crazy! (Thoughts) My
eardrums!
That scared
the heck out of me! For
a second there,
I thought my heart had burst through my ears!
I’ll never make it at this rate! When you’re in trouble, go back to basics!
You spineless fool!",Tanjirou,24,1,Thoughts, Out in the courtyard. Tanjirou practices his breathing.,1,,,,
"Breathing is all about the lungs.
If I can’t get the hang of it, that means my
lungs are too weak.
Work at it! All I can do is work hard! That’s
the story of my life!
Hard work is the sum of daily efforts! It can be one step at a time! Move forward!
Right!",Tanjirou,24,1,Thoughts, Out in the courtyard. Tanjirou practices his breathing.,1,,,,

Whenever she trained
Lady Kanao, Lady Shinobu often
had her blow into
gourds.",Kiyo,24,1,," Sometime later.

That’s a neat training
technique, huh? So, you make some sort of sound?",Tanjirou,24,1,," Sometime later.

Explode?
What? You mean this?!

ones.",Kiyo,24,1,," Sometime later.

and bigger as you progress. The one that Lady Kanao can explode
right now…",Kiyo,24,1,," Sometime later.

"While
throwing myself into the drills
that Mr. Urokodaki pounded into me, I’m
also maintaining my Total Concentration Breathing state.
Imagining
I’m running down a mountain, I race all around the mansion’s
garden! All of the obstacles are stand-ins for the trees on that mountain!
Hard work! Urahhh!
Hard work! Hard work! Hard work!!",Tanjirou,24,1,Thoughts," Over the next few days. Tanjirou
continues his rehabilitation.",1,,,,
"I’ve regained most of my stamina.
And now, I can run farther than I did before,
and my lungs are getting stronger! I’m making good progress!
During the day, I run all over the place and put my lungs into overdrive with swift moves, so now, I’ll breathe slowly.
I’ll take slow, deep breaths and send air
all the way to my fingertips.
Meditation boosts concentration. Mr. Urokodaki said so himself. (Thoughts) Mr. Urokodaki…

sword!",Tanjirou,24,1,Thoughts," 15 days later, at night. Tanjirou

soul, don’t you?
Um… Why did you bring us all here?",Shinobu,24,1,," 15 days later, at night. Tanjirou

"Nezuko’s existence
has been officially acknowledged, and the three of you were injured

my dream to you.",Shinobu,24,1,," 15 days later, at night. Tanjirou

My dream
that we can become friends
with the demons.
I’m quite sure you can accomplish that.",Tanjirou,24,1,," 15 days later, at night. Tanjirou

Are you angry?,Tanjirou,24,1,," 15 days later, at night. Tanjirou
sits on the roof of the Butterfly

up an angry scent from you even though you’re always smiling.",Tanjirou,24,1,," 15 days later, at night. Tanjirou
sits on the roof of the Butterfly
Manor.",1,,,,
"Yes… You’re right. It might be true that I’m in a constant
state of anger.
Ever since my
beloved older sister was slaughtered by a demon, every time I see the tears of those who’ve lost their
loved ones to a demon,
every time I hear those cries of despair… the anger keeps building up
inside me and continues to swell.
Deep down in the innermost depths
of my body, there’s a revulsion that I can’t fight. I’m sure the other Hashiras feel something similar, as well.
Well, this time,
they saw Nezuko, who’s never devoured a human, with their own eyes, and they’ve
memorized her presence. Out of respect
for the Master’s
wishes, I don’t think
anyone will raise a hand to her.",Shinobu,24,1,," 15 days later, at night. Tanjirou
sits on the roof of the Butterfly
Manor.",1,,,,
"My older
sister was a kind-hearted person like you. She had sympathy for demons. Even when she was on the brink of death,
she still felt pity for them.
I couldn’t
bring myself to feel that way. How can you feel sorry
for something that’s
killed humans? I’ve never heard of anything so absurd.
But if that was
how my sister truly felt, then I must carry it on. If there’s a way not to kill
these pitiful demons, I have to keep trying to come up with it… without ever extinguishing
the smile that my sister said she loved.
Sister…
Sister! Sister!! But now, I’m
a bit exhausted.
Demons do nothing but lie. Losing
all reason out of self-preservation, they murder humans
with their instincts laid totally bare.",Shinobu,24,1,Flashback," 15 days later, at night. Tanjirou
sits on the roof of the Butterfly
Manor.",1,,,,
"Tanjirou, please do all that you can. Please find a way to protect Nezuko until the end.
Knowing that you’re working
so hard in my place reassures me to no end. I can rest easy now.
Your Total Concentration Breathing
has come to a halt.",Shinobu,24,1,," 15 days later, at night. Tanjirou

nudge later!",Tanjirou,25,1,," In the morning.
Tanjirou goes to practice with Aoi.",1,,,,
"Ngh… Ugh… Urgh…
I’m starting to get used to training
while doing Total Concentration Breathing!
Although I can’t sustain it all day unless I really get myself pumped up, the
longer that I can keep doing Total Concentration Breathing, the bigger the stamina boost I
get!
You can do it!",Tanjirou,25,1,Thoughts," In the morning.
Tanjirou goes to practice with Aoi.",1,,,,

more! Thanks, all of
you!",Tanjirou,25,1,," A new day. Tanjirou

Zenitsu and Inosuke

nothing more draining
than persevering every day.",Zenitsu,25,1,Thoughts," A new day, in the morning.
Zenitsu and Inosuke
are asleep.",1,,,,
"Oh, it’s you.
Maybe getting
left behind by Tanjirou is making me panic, but I can’t
get the hang of anything
even if he shows me for hours.
Now I realize that we’re a total lost cause.
Wait, did you just say, “Yes,
you are”? How can you be so cruel? Would it kill you to say
just once, “You’re working hard, too”?
Did you just say, “Work harder”?
Haa… I guess there’s no way out of
it.",Zenitsu,25,1,," A new day, in the morning.

Impossible!! Seriously
impossible!",Shinobu,25,1,," In the Butterfly
Manor. Zenitsu and Inosuke speak
with Shinobu.",1,,,,
"I still
can’t sustain Total Concentration Breathing all day unless
I really throw myself into it, but I bet you two can do it!
You just go
like this to make your lungs expand!
When that rattles
your blood, your bones
and muscles will go “Boom, boom”, and you gotta stop it!",Tanjirou,25,1,, Sometime later. Zenitsu and Inosuke sit with Tanjirou.,1,,,,

crazy!",Tanjirou,25,1,, Sometime later. Zenitsu and Inosuke sit with Tanjirou.,1,,,,

about a basic skill, or should I say a beginner skill,

right?",Shinobu,25,1,, Sometime later. Zenitsu and Inosuke sit with Tanjirou.,1,,,,
Ah… Mm…,Inosuke,25,1,, Sometime later. Zenitsu and Inosuke sit with Tanjirou.,1,,,,

"I
was sure it would be child’s
play for you, Inosuke. Are you sure you can’t do it? Even
though there’s no reason you can’t do it?

Can’t be helped, can’t be helped.",Shinobu,25,1,, Sometime later. Zenitsu and Inosuke sit with Tanjirou.,1,,,,

examines Tanjirou.",1,,,,

examines Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"I’m not familiar with the details
myself… Please forgive
me. But I do know that they’re very strict about the exact

physically and I’ve gotten a little stronger, too. And I’m still doing
Total Concentration, Constant right now.
I think Zenitsu and Inosuke will be with me, too. Having those two by my side gives me confidence.",Tanjirou,25,1,," At night.
Tanjirou goes to Nezuko’s room. Nezuko is asleep.",1,,,,
"I see… You think
so, too, Nezuko?

with Kagaya.",1,,,,

made it twirl
around!",Tanjirou,26,1,, On the veranda overlooking the courtyard. Kanao sits by herself.,1,,,,
"I flip this to decide what I haven’t
been ordered to do. I just decided
whether or not to
speak with you.

for yourself? What did you want to do, Kanao? Kanao        It doesn’t matter.

Tanjirou confronts Enmu.",1,,,,
"All right, next… why don’t I show you a dream
where your father
comes back to life?
What I really
love… is to show people
nightmares right after a happy dream. (Thoughts) I just adore the sight
of a distorted human face.
I get such a kick out of that! How enthralling it is to gaze at someone
shattered by misfortune, suffering, and flailing.
But I
don’t usually let my guard down, so it may take longer, but I’ll make sure to kill the Demon Slayers.
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets. Once the conductor
punches them, creating clamp marks… the spell activates.
This is a remote art. It took more effort,
but this was the best way
to avoid being detected.
Not being detected
is important. It is reality
for them until they realize
it’s a dream.
And yet… how did this one manage to wake up? And he found the way to
wake up in a short time.
Even though the human desire
for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams…
… is so enormous!",Enmu,4,2,Thoughts," On top of the Mugen Train.

That’s the look I’ve been wanting
to see! Fufufu!
You want to know why I’m not dead after you decapitated me, don’t you? Fine, since I’m feeling so ecstatic
right now.
It’s so easy
that even an infant would understand. Fufufu! It’s because the body over there is no longer my main body.
Same with this thing that’s talking
to you now. It merely
looks like my head, but it’s not. While you were snoozing away… I
fused with this train!
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh, and my bones! Fufufu! Look at your face!
Are you getting it now? In other words…
the more than 200 passengers on this train are
the food that will strengthen my body even more… as well as my hostages.

I’ve taken! (Thoughts) It was
him! It’s all his fault!

I still struggled! I was held at
bay! Is this the power of a Hashira?

that girl! She’s a demon!

Daki’s room.",1,,,,
"There’s no need for you to be so scared.

yourself, you rotten
little punk!

suppose I may have lashed out at this newcomer

raise your head.

"That little brat…
From what I can sense,
his injuries are only minor.
Even though he’s blacked out… he went on the defensive. He’s no civilian.
He’s probably with the Demon
Slayer Corps. That said, he doesn’t have the
skill of a Hashira.",Daki,10,2,Thoughts," In the present,

House. Zenitsu rests in bed.",1,,,,
"Any man would rescue
a damsel in distress. That’s a given.
Not that I’m a man, all right? What I mean is, any human would,
see?
For instance, the eldest daughter
or whatever! I’m the eldest daughter, so I can’t stand by while a younger girl weeps! Not
normally!
Servant 1         That’s not true. Everyone
here has their hands full just taking
care of themselves.

I wanted to… rescue
my wives so badly, I made some bad decisions.
As it stands, Zenitsu
is missing. There’s
been no contact since last night.
You two should leave now. You’re ranked too low for this.
If the demon here turns out to be an Upper Rank,
you couldn’t handle it. If you vanish from here, they’ll
assume that you’re dead.

Ah… A passageway?,Inosuke,11,2,," On the rooftop
of a building. Tanjirou and Zenitsu meet up.",1,,,,
"That’s right.
And since it’s not coming
in and out, there’s a good chance that the demon is working on the inside.
If the demon’s working
in the House and cleverly
disguising itself as a human, then it’d be all the more careful about killing
people to make sure its cover won’t be blown.",Tanjirou,11,2,," On the rooftop

up after a murder would be a hassle. And wiping away bloodstains

district. It can be convenient for demons in more ways than one, but

in mind, too. And no matter
what… I don’t want you to
die.

"I’ll head to where Hinatsuru
is as I try to pinpoint the demon’s presence.

That demon’s weapon
is her belt. It has supernatural abilities. She can absorb humans inside it!

Shinjurou         (Flashback)
Dear Kamado… I know that I wronged you. (Flashback) Thank you for shedding tears over Kyoujurou.
I hear that you’ve also been exchanging letters with Senjurou
for the past four months. He seems to be in a much better place now.
I’m ashamed that our first meeting went the way it did.
At a time when my own incompetence had left me shattered, things went
from bad to worse when my wife succumbed to illness.
Since then, I’ve done nothing
but drink myself
into a stupor and wallow. There’s no bigger fool than me.
Unlike me, Kyoujurou was a fine son.
Even after I abandoned him as his instructor,
he trained by reading the Guide
to Flame Breathing and became a Hashira. Even though there were only three
volumes.
He must have had more of Ruka’s…
of his mother’s blood. Both Kyoujurou
and Senjurou are fine boys.
And Kamado… you have an even more amazing power.
I hear that those who are chosen to wield Sun Breathing… are born with the
same red mark on their forehead that you have. And so I’m sure that you…",Man,13,2,Flashback," In an area of the red-light district. Tanjirou breathes
heavily. Daki approaches him.",1,,,,
"No, Shinjurou… I wasn’t born with this scar.
Originally, it was a burn mark from when I protected my brother from a falling
brazier. Later, I injured myself
there during the Final Selection, and that’s how it
ended up the way it is now.
I hear
that my father
was born with a faint mark on his forehead,
but that wasn’t the case with
me.
I must not be a chosen wielder. Ngh…
But… even so… even if I’m not one of the chosen ones, even if I’m not up to the task…
… there are times when I just can’t back down! Because in this world,
there are those who lack human hearts!

I mean,
luckily there were tons of grown-ups around, but… it was scary for

I can still move. This time… I’m going to fight to the end… to the very end!
Gyuutarou       Tsk… This really pisses
me off. You’re good-looking, you have three wives, and on top of
that, you’re full of swagger.
You’re
different, aren’t you? You’re not
like any of the other Hashira I’ve killed. You must’ve been special
since the day you were born. A chosen talent,
right?
That makes me so jealous. I need
you to die as soon as
possible!",Tanjirou,15,2,Thoughts," At night,

"You may be centuries
old, but if you’ve
stayed shut up in a place like this, I guess

What do you know about it?!,Daki,15,2,," At night,
in the Entertainment District. Uzui faces off against Daki and Gyuutarou.",1,,,,
"I know, all right.
But you have no clue, do you? See, this country
is vast. It’s teeming with people who’d blow your mind.
Some are complete enigmas.
Some can take up a sword and become a Hashira in two
months.
Me, chosen?
Don’t give me that crap! Just how many lives do you think I’ve let slip through my fingers until now?
That’s
right… I can’t be like Rengoku!
Gyuutarou       Grr…
Then how do you explain
it?
My Blood Sickles are drenched with deadly poison,

refuse to die!",Uzui,15,2,Thoughts," At night,

The shinobi were wiped out during the Edo Period. Don’t give us that crap!,Daki,15,2,," At night,
in the Entertainment District. Uzui faces off against Daki and Gyuutarou.",1,,,,
"That’s no lie.
The shinobi exist.
I had nine brothers and sisters. Seven of them died by the
time I turned 15.
Panicked
by our clan’s decline, my father, just like a man possessed, forced us to submit to brutal training.
The only survivors
were myself and my brother,
who was two years younger.
My
brother was exactly like my father. The same mindset, the same mannerisms. His subordinates were pawns. His wives were expendable if they produced heirs. No one else ever had any
say. Resolutely indifferent.
And I… didn’t
want to become like him!
Ubuyashiki      (Flashback) It’s hard, isn’t it, Tengen?
The path you have chosen.
Rejecting the values that shape you, that were instilled in you during your
childhood, even as you place yourself on the battlefield… That’s surely
agonizing.
Carrying
all that conflict
and quandaries inside
yourself, you still…
all of you still persist in moving forward and battling on. Isn’t that
right? So that you can protect other people’s lives.
Thank you. You’re
a remarkable child.
I’m the one who should
be grateful.",Uzui,15,2,Thoughts," At night,
in the Entertainment District. Uzui faces off against Daki and Gyuutarou.",1,,,,
"Master,
for your sake,
I’d never think twice about laying down my life.
I can surely accomplish
anything.
Those who have baggage like conflict or quandaries are spineless fools. That’s always been the story of my
life.

Hm? Hmm?
Hehe… Hehehehe…",Uzui,15,2,Thoughts, In the present. Uzui regains his spirit.,1,,,,

about?

poison’s slowly affecting you, after all. Slowly but surely.

humiliating, huh? Hehehehe…",Uzui,15,2,, In the present. Uzui regains his spirit.,1,,,,
"Oh, no! It has absolutely no effect on me! Wanna see me dance?
I’m so on fire that I could eat 100 bowls of tempura

Don’t you dare kick my little sister!",Uzui,15,2,, In the present. Uzui regains his spirit.,1,,,,
"You scumbag!
Gyuutarou       Ah…!
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) Well, those are unique explosions. They can inflict
damage to a demon’s body and explode with the slightest
friction from a strike.
She got hit because she slashed one without realizing
that. She’s always taking a hit, that one!
Gyuutarou       Ah!
Guh…
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) The blade is extending…!
Gyuutarou       What…?
He’s holding onto the tip of his sword. What kind of insane grip does he have?!

the chance to finish off this one!",Uzui,15,2,, In the present. Uzui regains his spirit.,1,,,,

Damn you! Damn you… I’ll make you pay for this!
It’s not fair… It’s not fair. Why am I the one who’s always getting
beheaded? Ahhh!!
Gyuutarou       You…
You’re onto us, aren’t you?",Daki,15,2,, In the present. Uzui regains his spirit.,1,,,,
"About what?
Gyuutarou       Not that finding out about
us will do you any good!
You’re going to die a slow and steady
death, anyway.
Even as we speak,
we’re creeping toward victory, aren’t
we?",Uzui,15,2,, In the present. Uzui regains his spirit.,1,,,,
"I don’t know about
that!
Better not forget me! Not only yours truly, Lord Inosuke,

entrances! That’s what I like to see!

that they’re so small. There are still
three fledgling Demon Slayers, too…

are no…
No. Would they really try to pull off such a meaningless attack? (Thoughts) Blood Demon Art, Rampant Arc Rampage!

at me! (Thoughts) There’s one
stuck in you. A kunai, piercing you, too!
That’s
right, he’s a shinobi. Not a swordsman. This guy’s always
had otherworldly senses.

the…!

with something extracted from wisteria! M-My body’s

Gyuutarou       Ngh…
Urgh!
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) Seriously, that was a lightning-fast move… (Thoughts) There’s no way he can
still move like that!",Tanjirou,16,2,Thoughts, In the present. Uzui comes to his senses.,1,,,,
"I did it… I did it!
Blend
the breathing techniques! Use Water Breathing and the Hinokami Kagura in combination! That’ll
give me more attack power than I’d have with just Water Breathing, and I’ll also be able to
move longer than with just the Hinokami Kagura!
I’m sure the swordsmen who’ve fought the demons until now did just that.
Taking
the breathing techniques and sword skills that suited
them best and modifying them into the form that
would allow them to exert maximum power! They racked their brains! That’s why
so many different offshoots have been created!
Modify
it… into any form. Be flexible! That’s
the fighting style that
Urokodaki taught me!
Even if I can never fully master
Water Breathing like Tomioka has, I won’t
let what Urokodaki taught me go to waste!
Gyuutarou       Either way, you’re going down!
Gyuutarou       Urahh…",Tanjirou,16,2,Thoughts, In the present. Uzui comes to his senses.,1,,,,

Crap! We can’t bring this one down unless
we strike in tandem!

things up as we flee,

her attacks somehow,

"Big Bro, why are you always apologizing?
If we’re poor, does that make us unhappy?
If we can’t wear pretty
kimonos, should people pity
us?
Are you so determined to blame someone?
You think it was our father's fault for
dying of illness.
He tried as hard as he could, and it wasn’t
enough, so we just have to accept
that! We’re humans, after
all, so none of us can expect everything to go our way.
Whether you’re happy or not is up to you. The important thing is now.",Nezuko,17,2,," In Tanjirou’s subconscious. Tanjirou stands in a snowy

I have to do what I
can do!
Gyuutarou       What’s this? You’re still alive?
Gyuutarou       You’re one lucky guy, huh? Well,
not that you have anything
going for you except being lucky.
Gyuutarou       I
feel sorry for you. Everyone
but you is probably done for.
A single thrust to that boar’s heart. That towheaded boy’s trapped under the rubble,
and he’s flailing, so I’m just going to leave him there until he dies. Squirming like an insect… How disgraceful is that!
And how weak was that Hashira! All he had was bluster!
The poison got to him, stopping
his heart, and now he’s dead! It’s all over for him!
So disgraceful! So disgraceful! You four are truly disgraceful! Especially you! You’re
in another league!
The one sticking out of
that box you carry is a relative, right?
I can tell that she’s
closely related to you even if she’s a demon now. Is she your older or
younger sister?",Tanjirou,17,2,Thoughts, In the entertainment district. Tanjirou wakes up with a start.,1,,,,
"Why won’t he kill me? What is this?
My arm is numb. I still have no strength.
Even if I went for his head now, I
couldn’t slash it.
Nezuko… is my younger
sister.
Gyuutarou       Fu… Fufu… Fufufufu!! Just as I thought! You really are a disgrace! You’re not protecting your little sister at all!
Gyuutarou       Well, I guess it can’t be helped. Since
you’re a human and your sister’s a demon.
Of course you’re weaker
than your demon
sister. Even so, what a disgrace!
If you’re her big
bro…
Gyuutarou       … instead of being protected
by your little sister, you should be protecting her.
Devotedly. With this hand, see? Hehehe!",Tanjirou,17,2,Thoughts, In the entertainment district. Tanjirou wakes up with a start.,1,,,,
"Gah! Ahh… Guh!
Gyuutarou       Hehehehahaha!
Hey, listen!
Gyuutarou       How
do you feel now? Being
the only one to survive
so disgracefully!
That little sister you rely on has all but used up her
strength!
Gyuutarou       Hey, worm! Dimwit! Sad sack! Coward!
Good-for-nothing! Why were you even born,
huh?!
What are you gonna do? With your weak sauce, battered, disgraceful human body! Let’s see you cut off my head! Come
on! Come on! Come on!!",Tanjirou,17,2,, In the entertainment district. Tanjirou wakes up with a start.,1,,,,

I like anything that’s pathetic, disgraceful, and filthy! This
filthy scar on your forehead!
Gyuutarou       I
like it! I think I’m getting attached
to it!
I know! Why don’t you become
a demon, too? For your little sister’s
sake as well!
That’s it! That’s it! What a great
idea! If you become a demon, I’ll spare your life! We’ll be
friends!
Otherwise, I’ll slaughter your sister, too. Since I really don’t give a crap about
other people’s little sisters.",Tanjirou,17,2,, In the entertainment district. Tanjirou wakes up with a start.,1,,,,
"No way! You’d better
not, Brother! I’m so not on board with that, all right?
Gyuutarou       If you become a demon, you can become stronger, just like that! You can kiss that defective physical body goodbye!
Hey! Hey! What’s it gonna be?
Gyuutarou       Hahahaha… Your own weakness
makes you bitter,
doesn’t it? When humans grieve, they look up to the sky. You know,
so their tears don’t overflow.",Daki,17,2,, In the entertainment district. Tanjirou wakes up with a start.,1,,,,
"I… I… I was waiting for this moment.
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) A last-ditch headbutt,
huh? That had zero effect
on me!

"Brother, what are you doing? Get on your feet!
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) Something’s wrong. What’s going
on? Something’s wrong! It was nothing but a lame human headbutt!
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) A kunai! I got stabbed
when he headbutted me!
This brat was pretending to run away when he was really going for this kunai! He scattered the courtesans’
sachets along with the rubble to cover up the scent of the kunai’s poison!
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) Damn you… Damn you! You’re
a weakling! A stinking human!
Look how beat up you are after I rubbed
my superior strength
in your face!
Why won’t you give up when you’re on your own? Why won’t you cave in?! (Thoughts) The will to bring me
down… Why is it so unswerving?!",Daki,17,2,Thoughts, In the entertainment district. Tanjirou wakes up with a start.,1,,,,

I was lucky enough to remain a human,

been a future in which we
were both demons.

if I end up turning
into a demon, I’m sure… that
someone in the Demon Slayer Corps will do me the favor of beheading me.

give me that crap! If you
were on your own, you’d be long dead by now!
How many times have I saved you?!
You’re the worthless one, and
you know it. You’re weak, and you have no value
whatsoever!

I’m so pissed!
I’m so pissed! Fix this somehow, Brother! I don’t want to die, Brother!
Brother! Bro --
Gyuutarou       Ume!
That’s
right. My little
sister’s name was Ume.
(Thoughts) Not Daki. What a god-awful name.
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts)
No… Ume was pretty bad, too. Since you were named after the disease
that killed our mother.
The
Rashomon Riverbank. We were born into the lowest class of the Entertainment District. Children were seen as extra mouths to feed, so we were cursed
just for living.
My mother nearly
killed me more than once before I was ever born.
And she also tried to kill me
numerous times after I was born, since I was nothing but a burden. And yet, I
still survived.
My body was weak like a withered
leaf, but I clung to life as hard as I could.
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) Worm! Dimwit! Sad sack! Coward!
Good-for-nothing!
I was mocked
for my ugly voice and appearance, and rocks were thrown at me for being filthy.
It was as if all the abuse and insults
in the world were created
just for me.
Not only was I ugly, but I was filthy,
too. Always covered
in grime and dandruff
from head to toe. Giving off the stench of fleas.
I was especially despised in the Entertainment District,
where beauty was the
measure of your value. As if I were a monster.
When
I got hungry, I ate mice and insects. (Thoughts) My only toy was a scythe that a customer
left behind.
Things
started to change for me… after Ume was born.
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) Ume… You were my pride and joy.
Even at a tender age, grown-ups would reel at the sight of your beautiful face.",Daki,18,2,Thoughts," Elsewhere in the ruins of the entertainment district. Nezuko carries Tanjirou on her back as they search for Daki and Gyuutarou’s
heads.",1,,,,
"Ngh… Eek!
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) I discovered that I was good at fighting and started working
as a debt collector.
I revolted everyone,
and they all feared me. That made me feel so good.
My ugliness became
a source of pride… and having a gorgeous sister
like you dispelled my sense of inferiority.
I had the feeling that we were on the fast track to a better life.
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) Until you turned thirteen, Ume.
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts)
Because you stabbed a customer, a samurai’s eye with a hairpin, blinding him, you were bound hand and foot
out of retaliation and then burned alive!
I wasn’t there. I got home from work to find you burnt to a crisp.",Man,18,2,Thoughts," Sometime
later. Daki, who is still a human,
has become a teenager.",1,,,,
"Ugh… Ngh…
Gyuutarou       Ah…
Ahhh!! Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Don’t collect from me! You’re collecting from me after never giving
me a damn thing?!
I’ll never forgive you! I’ll never
forgive you!! Turn my sister back to the way she was! Or else… I’ll kill the gods, Buddha,
every one of you!
Gyuutarou       Gah…",Daki,18,2,," In Daki and Gyuutarou’s house. Gyuutarou stands
over Daki’s body.",1,,,,
You’re sure he’s the one?,Samurai,18,2,," In Daki and Gyuutarou’s house. Gyuutarou stands
over Daki’s body.",1,,,,
"Yes! That’s him, all right!
I appreciate this! I’m so glad to be rid of that troublemaker!
He was such a savage, severely
injuring the people
he was collecting from! And lately,
he’s really been out of control!
It’s a shame that we lost Ume, but when I find another
pretty girl, I’ll send her your way. So, um, about the money…",Woman,18,2,," In Daki and Gyuutarou’s house. Gyuutarou stands
over Daki’s body.",1,,,,
"Hold on. After I finish him off.
Gyuutarou       Hey,
you… That’s a fine kimono
you’re wearing, huh?
Gyuutarou       You’re clean, and you have a good complexion. I bet you always have plenty
to eat and you sleep in a
nice, clean bed.
I bet that’s all you’ve ever known. Living
in a house that shelters
you from the rain and wind. Lucky you… Lucky you!
A guy who has it so good doesn’t
get to make such a racket. Sniveling
and moaning…
Gyuutarou       …
over one measly
eyeball.
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) No one would help us. No surprises
there.
That was just the story of our lives. No one ever offered us a helping
hand.
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) It started snowing.
We were never shown the slightest mercy, no matter
what the situation.
Why was that?
What happened to “fortune and misfortune are intertwined”?! Both fortune and misfortune should come by turns!",Samurai,18,2,Thoughts," In Daki and Gyuutarou’s house. Gyuutarou stands
over Daki’s body.",1,,,,
"Hey, what’s the matter?
You poor things.
I happen to be kindhearted, so I can’t
look the other way.
That girl is probably going to die any minute now.
Ah… I’ll give you some blood! Both of you!
If he chooses you, you can become demons.",Douma,18,2,," Sometime later.
Gyuutarou carries Daki’s burnt body through the area.",1,,,,
"Life is a sacred
thing. You should treasure it.
Now then… can you become demons…
a Twelve Kizuki
like me… and rise up to the Upper Ranks, I wonder.
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) I don’t regret
becoming a demon.
No matter
how many times I’m reborn,
I’m going to be a demon every time. I’ll never show mercy to anyone who has a
better life. I’ll always be the Gyuutarou who seizes and collects!
But… if I did have one regret, that would be… Ume… You might’ve turned out
differently than me.
If you’d worked
at a better House, you could’ve become
a respectable oiran… If you’d been born to normal
parents, you could’ve been a normal girl… If
you’d been born into a good family, maybe you would’ve become a well-bred young
lady.
You have such an impressionable, pliant nature. Maybe you only turned out this way because I was the one who
raised you.
“Take before someone
takes from you.”
I taught you to collect from others,
and that’s why you stabbed that samurai in the eye. But if you’d done as he
said, you might’ve followed a different path.
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) My only regret…",Douma,18,2,Thoughts," Sometime later.
Gyuutarou carries Daki’s burnt body through the area.",1,,,,
"Ah… Fufu!
Gyuutarou       (Thoughts) … was you, I guess.
Gyuutarou       What
is this place? Is this Hell?
Gyuutarou       Ah…",Daki,18,2,Imagination," Sometime later.
Gyuutarou carries Daki’s burnt body through the area.",1,,,,
"It’s awful
here! I don’t like this
place!
Where are we? I want to leave! Do
something!
Gyuutarou       You…
Look at you…",Daki,18,2,," In the present, in a void. Gyuutarou finds himself alone.",1,,,,
"Is the exit that way?
Gyuutarou       Listen. Don’t follow me anymore.
Daki   B-But why? Wait, I -- Gyuutarou       I
said don’t follow me!",Daki,18,2,," In the present, in a void. Gyuutarou finds himself alone.",1,,,,
"Are you mad about what I said? I’ll apologize, so forgive me!",Daki,18,2,," In the present, in a void. Gyuutarou finds himself alone.",1,,,,
"I
don’t think you’re ugly, Brother!
I was just bitter!
I was bitter because
we’d lost! I didn’t
want to admit that we’d lost because of me!
I’m sorry!
For not fighting
better! If only I
could’ve been more useful, then we wouldn’t have lost! I’m sorry I’m always
dragging you down!
Listen, Brother!
Gyuutarou       You’re not my sister
anymore. You’re nothing
to me.
I’m heading this way, so you go in the opposite
direction, toward the light.
Gyuutarou       Ah…
Hey!",Daki,18,2,," In the present, in a void. Gyuutarou finds himself alone.",1,,,,
"No… No!
I’m not leaving you! I’m never
going to leave you, okay?

going to be together! No matter how many times

you

so mean! Don’t
you remember the promise we made?
Gyuutarou       Ah…",Daki,18,2,," In the present, in a void. Gyuutarou finds himself alone.",1,,,,
"Have you forgotten?
Gyuutarou       (Flashback) The two of us together
can’t be beat! Being cold or hungry
doesn’t bother us at all!
I promise you! We’re always going to be together!
I’m never going to leave you!
See? You’re not afraid of anything now, are you?",Daki,18,2,Flashback," In the present, in a void. Gyuutarou finds himself alone.",1,,,,
"I wonder if they made up.
It’s over, huh? I’m
exhausted.",Tanjirou,18,2,," In the present.
Tanjirou and Nezuko hold the last of Gyuutarou’s head in their hands.
His particles float into the sky and disappear.",1,,,,

I don’t care if you’re a Hashira or whatever! You’re too full of yourself!,Kotetsu,1,3,," Sometime later. Tanjirou explores
the village.",1,,,,
Just get out of my sight!,Kotetsu,1,3,," Sometime later. Tanjirou explores
the village.",1,,,,
"The Mist Hashira, Muichirou Tokitou!
So there’s another Hashira
here at the village.",Tanjirou,1,3,," Sometime later. Tanjirou explores

the village.",1,,,,
I said I’m not giving it to you!,Kotetsu,1,3,," Sometime later. Tanjirou explores
the village.",1,,,,
"Ah… Is that… a person? Who could it be?
I know him. I’ve… seen that man before!
",Tanjirou,1,3,Thoughts," Sometime later. Tanjirou explores
the village.",1,,,,
"Get lost, will you?! I’m not giving you that key, no matter
what! And don’t think I’m ever going to show you how to use it!",Kotetsu,2,3,," In the Swordsmith Village.
Kotetsu argues with Tokitou. Something that looks like Yoriichi stands behind Kotetsu.",1,,,,
"What’s going on? Are those
two fighting?
What should I do? It’s bad manners
to eavesdrop! But if they’re
fighting, I should try to
mediate…",Tanjirou,2,3,Thoughts," In the Swordsmith Village.
Kotetsu argues with Tokitou. Something that looks like Yoriichi stands behind Kotetsu.",1,,,,
"What do you think you’re doing?!
Take your hands off him!",Tanjirou,2,3,," In the Swordsmith Village.
Kotetsu argues with Tokitou. Something that looks like Yoriichi stands behind Kotetsu.",1,,,,
Your voice is very annoying. Who are you?,Tokitou,2,3,," In the Swordsmith Village.
Kotetsu argues with Tokitou. Something that looks like Yoriichi stands behind Kotetsu.",1,,,,
"How could you do that to a little
kid? Take your hands… Ngh! (Thoughts) He’s not even budging!
He’s got thinner
arms than me, and he’s not even that big!",Tanjirou,2,3,Thoughts," In the Swordsmith Village.
Kotetsu argues with Tokitou. Something that looks like Yoriichi stands behind Kotetsu.",1,,,,
"You take your hands
off me.",Tokitou,2,3,," In the Swordsmith Village.
Kotetsu argues with Tokitou. Something that looks like Yoriichi stands behind Kotetsu.",1,,,,
You’re quite weak.,Tokitou,2,3,," In the Swordsmith Village.
Kotetsu argues with Tokitou. Something that looks like Yoriichi stands behind Kotetsu.",1,,,,
"It’s a wonder you got into the Demon
Slayer Corps.
I’m getting a strange
vibe from that box. A demon’s presence,
perhaps?
What’s inside? That box there…",Tokitou,2,3,," In the Swordsmith Village.
Kotetsu argues with Tokitou. Something that looks like Yoriichi stands behind Kotetsu.",1,,,,
"Don’t you dare touch
it!",Tanjirou,2,3,," In the Swordsmith Village.
Kotetsu argues with Tokitou. Something that looks like Yoriichi stands behind Kotetsu.",1,,,,
Ahh… Huh?,Tokitou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
He took him.,Tokitou,2,3,Thoughts, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
L-Let go of me!,Kotetsu,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
You must be dizzy. That’s dangerous!,Tanjirou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
Get out of here!,Kotetsu,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
"I’m not… I’m not giving that key to anyone! Not even if you torture
me! One more time, and it’s
going to break down!",Kotetsu,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
"Have you been through
torture training?",Tokitou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
"Even most grown-ups can’t take it. You’d never last. I can see that you’re
stupid beyond belief.
So what if it breaks down? Just make another one. How
many people do you think will
perish while you drone on and on about trivial matters?",Tokitou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
"That’s what it means to obstruct a Hashira in his duty. A Hashira’s time is worth far more than time spent by you people. If you
think a little, you’ll eventually get that, won’t you?",Tokitou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
Swordsmiths can’t fight.,Tokitou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,

don’t know why, but… I can’t
stand you! What is it? Tact, maybe?
You have no tact, and you’re cruel!",Tanjirou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
You think this is cruel? You…,Tokitou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
"You’re not wrong! I admit that what you’re
saying is mostly
true, and it’s probably not wrong! But being a swordsmith is an
important, vital job!",Tanjirou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
"Swordsmiths have amazing skills
that are totally
different from ours! The fact is that if we didn’t have them to forge our swords,
we couldn’t do anything, could we?
Swordsmen and swordsmiths need each other!
We’re all fighting
the same battle!
Day in and day out, each in
our own way, we’re fighting --",Tanjirou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
"Sorry… but I don’t have time to stand
here listening to your boring speech.",Tokitou,2,3,, In the Swordsmith Village. Tokitou looks at his hand.,1,,,,
"What should I do? Can I carry
him down by myself? Haganezuka       No, I’ll carry him, as long as he doesn’t come to soon. Tanjirou    Ngh…
Haganezuka    Huh? His eyelids are twitching! He’s about to wake up!
See you!",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime

You shouldn’t get up so fast.",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime

Was Mr. Haganezuka here?!,Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime

here! Haha~!",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime

Ah… Where’s that Hashira?",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"I handed over the key, so he took off.",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"So you handed it over, huh? I know you didn’t
seem to have a choice.
Well, since I don’t know what’s going on, I shouldn’t
be making a fuss about it.",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"Oh no, don’t say
that!
It made me happy.
I’m a stranger to you, but you stood up for me. Thank
you very much!",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime

about the situation.",1,,,,
"No, I wasn’t that much help!
Where’s that man or whatever who was standing
here?",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime

That was a mechanical doll.,Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
Mechanical doll?,Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"That guy just took it away with him. He needed
the key to make the doll move.",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"So it’s really important
to you, huh?",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
But what would a Hashira want with it?,Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"That one’s special.
That mechanical doll can overpower
a human, and it’s capable of 108 moves.
It can be used to train for combat.",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
So that’s why…,Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
But… now it’s…,Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
That guy must’ve already…,Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
Against a Hashira… Wow!,Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"That’s the mechanical doll built by my ancestors, Yoriichi Type Zero.",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
But… why does he have six arms?,Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"His arms? According to my father,
that doll was modeled on an actually
swordsman, but his moves
couldn’t be replicated unless they gave it six arms.
That face… It somehow seems familiar, but I’m not
sure.
That swordsman… Who was he? What did he do and
where?",Kotetsu,2,3,Thoughts," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"Uh, sorry, but I don’t know too much about him, either. He was from the Sengoku
Period.",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
S-Sengoku? You mean he lived more than 300 years ago?,Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
That’s what I was told.,Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"That doll has never
broken down in all that time?",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"The technology’s so mind-blowing that we can’t
catch up to it today.
If it were to break down, there’d be no fixing
it.",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"My father passed away suddenly, and I have no brothers
or sisters. I’m the one who’s
supposed to step up now, but since I’m no good with swords or mechanical dolls…",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"So that’s why you were so… Right, I get
it.
That guy’s incredible. He’s only around my age… but he’s a Hashira,
and he’s so talented.",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"Well, what did you expect?",Crow,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"After all, he’s a descendant of the wielder
of the Sun Breathing technique!
That boy is a prodigy! He’s in a different league than the likes of you! Hohoho~!",Crow,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"Are you Tokitou’s crow? The first
breathing style, Sun Breathing? So he’s really
that amazing…",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"But that’s not Sun Breathing that he’s using now, is it?",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries

or I’ll gouge
out your eyes!",Crow,2,3,," Sometime

now! That dream!
I saw that man in a dream!",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries

"Huh?! Are you an idiot or what?! Have you been to this village before?
That’s so preposterous, you
make me laugh!",Crow,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"You mean you’ve met a warrior
from the Sengoku
Period? How old are you, exactly?",Crow,2,3,," Sometime

about the situation.",1,,,,
"Listen, I’m sorry. There’s
something wrong with me, right?",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
"No, no!
Maybe it’s an inherited memory?
People talk about it all the time in our village.
It isn’t just your physical
form that gets passed on. Living creatures pass on
their memories, too.",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Kotetsu worries
about the situation.",1,,,,
What you saw in your dream must’ve been your ancestor’s memory!,Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime

so kind of you! Thanks! Crow  Blegh!",Crow,2,3,," Sometime

What’s your name?",Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime

Even if it’s not in good shape right
now.
I think he went this way…",Tanjirou,2,3,," In the forests

looks for Kotetsu.",1,,,,
"Kotetsu! Could you have climbed any higher, Kotetsu?
If there’s
anything I can do, I’ll help you out. You can’t
give up on your doll! You have a future ahead of you!",Tanjirou,2,3,," In the forests

looks for Kotetsu.",1,,,,

I won’t! I don’t need anyone

going to end with my generation! All because of me!",Kotetsu,2,3,," In the forests

making a sound.
That’s what a swordsman can do.",Kotetsu,2,3,Thoughts," In the forests

looks for Kotetsu.",1,,,,
"Even if you can’t do it
yourself, there’s always
someone who will carry on for you. You
have to do what you can so that it gets passed on.

you, maybe your kids or grandkids might find a way, right?",Tanjirou,2,3,," In the forests

want to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji. I want to save my sister, who’s

looks for Kotetsu.",1,,,,
"But
I have faith that someone will surely finish the job for me. Just like we were
able to beat an Upper Rank demon with the lives that were connected
for us, someday, for sure, the lives we’ve connected will bring
down Kibutsuji!",Tanjirou,2,3,," In the forests
of the Swordsmith Village. Tanjirou
looks for Kotetsu.",1,,,,
"Let’s do our best together!
I didn’t want to
see the doll break down, but my mind is made up now. The combat training should last
until nightfall, so I’m going to brace myself
to see it through to the end.",Tanjirou,2,3,," In the forests

support!",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime later.

spars with the Yoriichi mechanical doll.",1,,,,

Tanjirou, please become stronger!
And this is what you’re
going to say to him…
“Is that all you’ve
got, you scumbag?”",Kotetsu,2,3,," Some time later. Tanjirou

spars with the Yoriichi mechanical doll.",1,,,,
"You’re not deciding how to move after observing your opponent’s moves.
That’s why you’re no good! Do
you understand?
In other words,
you don’t have the basics down! I’m really amazed you’ve managed to survive
this long in the Demon Slayer Corps! You’re cutting it close with everything
you do! Well, I’m here to denounce
your ever weak point backward
and forward! I’m not giving you any food until you can do
everything I tell you to!",Kotetsu,2,3,," Some time later. Tanjirou

Tanjirou continues to train. He gets struck
by the mechanical doll.",1,,,,
"Ahh… The highly
analytical Kotetsu!
But as a swordsmanship instructor, he was a total amateur. Since he had no
idea about the limits of a human
life, his training
sessions were brutal!
So tyrannical that he’d withhold food and water from you
if you failed to meet his demands!
After three days or so without water,
a human will seriously die.",Tanjirou,2,3,Narration," Some days later.
Tanjirou continues to train. He gets struck
by the mechanical doll.",1,,,,

I was able to survive,
thanks to some rainfall.
Gahhh!",Tanjirou,2,3,Narration," Some days later.
Tanjirou continues to train. He gets struck
by the mechanical doll.",1,,,,
"All through these ghastly training
sessions, I went without water, food, or sleep.
I started to cross the River to the Afterlife.
I was walking
across a bridge,
feeling indescribably blissful,
only to get dizzy from hunger
and fall into the river.
It was dark in the water and heavy, but then it felt
as though I were being massaged by some warm hands.
I saw something shiny when I glanced
toward the bottom
of the river, so when I went to get it, all while being
massaged.
Strangely enough, I could smell this shimmering stone
even underwater.
What is this smell? It smells different
from the opening
thread. Ah!
Left side of the head! Neck! Right side of the chest! Left side!
(Thoughts) Right thigh! Right shoulder!
Here it comes!",Tanjirou,2,3,Thoughts," Some days later. Tanjirou
continues to train,
now with real swords.",1,,,,
"You got one strike
in, Tanjirou! Though it was so feeble
that the doll didn’t even flinch!
I’m going to give you some
food!",Kotetsu,2,3,," Some days later. Tanjirou
continues to train,
now with real swords.",1,,,,
"Rice balls and pickled
plums! And I want high-quality gyokuro tea!",Tanjirou,2,3,," Some days later. Tanjirou

Tasty!!,Tanjirou,2,3,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou eats his first meal.",1,,,,
"All right… All right! I see how he’s going to move!
I can see it way better than before! I can keep up now that I have my stamina back!
Now, I can tell by the scent where he’s going to strike!",Tanjirou,2,3,Thoughts," Sometime
later. Tanjirou gets back to training with the mechanical doll.",1,,,,
"I can pick up this scent sooner
than I can see the opening thread!",Tanjirou,2,3,Thoughts," Sometime
later. Tanjirou gets back to training with the mechanical doll.",1,,,,
"All right. I’m going for it! One strike with all my might!
(Thoughts) Ah… But what if it breaks?",Tanjirou,2,3,Thoughts," Sometime
later. Tanjirou gets back to training with the mechanical doll.",1,,,,
Strike!,Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou gets back to training with the mechanical doll.",1,,,,

I’ll fix it, no matter
what!",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou gets back to training with the mechanical doll.",1,,,,
"Tanjirou, you’re too nice!
You can’t hesitate
now!
But that’s who you are, Tanjirou, and I don’t want you to die!",Kotetsu,2,3,Thoughts," Sometime
later. Tanjirou gets back to training with the mechanical doll.",1,,,,
"I want you… to become
stronger than anyone else!",Kotetsu,2,3,Thoughts," Sometime

later. Tanjirou gets back to training with the mechanical doll.",1,,,,

"Hey, hey! I have no idea,
either!",Kotetsu,2,3,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou gets back to training with the mechanical doll.",1,,,,
"What could that be? At the very least,
it’s a sword from over 300 years
ago, right?

Kanamori         Oh, long time no see,
Tanjirou. Mr. Haganezuka always goes limp for a while after being tickled, so I’ll do the explaining.

out in the mountains to train.",Tanjirou,3,3,," In the Swordsmith Village.
Haganezuka steps into the light.",1,,,,

Haganezuka steps into the light.",1,,,,
"For me?
Kanamori  All this time, you’ve
been asking Mr. Haganezuka for another sword,

restore it!",Kotetsu,3,3,," In the Swordsmith Village.
Haganezuka steps into the light.",1,,,,
"Then why didn’t you just say so from the start?
Instead of “leave
it to me, leave it to me” when you have zero trust built up?

again!",Kotetsu,3,3,," In the Swordsmith Village.

Haganezuka steps into the light.",1,,,,

yesterday. They say it takes three days and three nights to polish a sword,

Doing something for others won’t get you

can’t trust the word of a man who died trying to help someone
else.

if some herbs would’ve healed her in that state.

Brother!

only telling you how it is. Don’t yell. It’s too noisy. You might attract some boars.

Someone who can’t even cook rice on his own becoming
a swordsman?! Save others?!

Seriously, you’re
exactly like Father

you?! You’re too optimistic! How does your mind even work?!
Just like Mother, who worked without
telling us she was unwell
until she collapsed! Just like Father, who went out in a storm to find herbs!
After all… After all I did to try to stop him! After
I begged Mother
to rest over and over! You know who can help others? Only
the chosen ones!
Our ancestors may have been swordsmen, but what can kids like us to?!
Want me to tell you what it
is we can do? What you and I
can do is die like dogs and die
in vain! Because we’re Father and Mother’s children!

hold on! What is that mark?
According to the information Lord Muzan gave me, that child with the earrings also has a similar mark… No,
never mind that! How can you stand there looking so nonchalant? My attack

Yuuichirou       (Flashback) Muichirou… Sorry I couldn’t be more gentle

Yuuichirou       (Flashback) Being kind to others… is one more thing that only the chosen ones can do.

"I’ve never seen a sword
shaped like that!
It’s too fast to follow

on the door for her
son.",1,,,,

calls for Kibutsuji, who is still a human.",1,,,,
"If I may, sir… Your medicine
is ready for you now.
H.Kibutsuji        You
inept doctor…

is the only one I have to lean on.

you will not live to see your twentieth birthday. I am doing all I can to help you live even a little longer.

right, fine. That’s
enough.

H.Kibutsuji        (Thoughts) Ahh… I want to destroy
them! Every living
being!
No matter
how many times he examines
me or administers that medicine, nothing can stop my symptoms
from worsening.

some medicine.",1,,,,
"But then I realized that this doctor’s
medicine was working
not long after I’d
killed him.
My body was bursting with energy, and I thought
that I’d gained
a durable physique, but there
was a problem.
I couldn’t walk in the sunlight.
I could tell that if exposed to sunlight, I would die.
I began to crave human flesh and blood.
To remedy that, all I had to do was devour humans.
If anyone stands
in your way, just eliminate
them. That’s all there is to it.",Kibutsuji,11,3,Narration," Sometime later.

confront Kibutsuji as he roams the streets.",1,,,,
"I had gained
power. Eternal power!
But… having to restrict my movements during
the day was humiliating, and my anger only grew. I began to seek a
body that wouldn’t perish in the sunlight.
I examined the compounds for the doctor’s
elixir, but perhaps
because it was still in the experimental stages, I
couldn’t figure out how to make the medicine called “Blue Spider Lily”.
It did seem to contain actual
blue-colored spider lilies,
but as for where this Blue Spider Lily bloomed or whether or not it could be cultivated,
no one knew but the doctor I’d
killed. I searched all over Japan but failed to find it.
In order to become
truly immortal, finding
the Blue Spider
Lily and someone who had the ability to survive
the sunlight have been my top priorities.",Kibutsuji,11,3,Narration," On a dark and stormy night. Soldiers
confront Kibutsuji as he roams the streets.",1,,,,
"And at last, I’ve found
her!
Since that girl has conquered
the sun, there’s
no longer any reason to increase my kind. I will absorb her,
and then I will conquer the sunlight!
I will get my hands on Nezuko and become the perfect
being!",Kibutsuji,11,3,Thoughts," In the present.

his sense of self. It’s thanks to Nezuko’s blood.”
“Released
from Muzan’s control,
he can live on a small amount
of blood.”
“The transformation of Nezuko’s blood surprises me. In such a short time,
the components of her blood have changed again and again.”
“All this time, I
have been thinking about why it
is that Nezuko has yet to regain her sense of self and remains in
a childlike state.”
“I believe that in Nezuko’s
mind, there’s something
more important than regaining her sense of self,
something that she needs to prioritize.”

Sorry to keep you waiting.,Iguro,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,

"Yeah. They were strong!
I felt like I couldn’t
do it anymore, but we all pulled
together.
Right, Muichirou?

That makes me jealous. Why haven’t I encountered an Upper Rank?",Kanroji,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,

I’m still not in my best form.",Tokitou,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,

that matter, too.",Tomioka,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,

At today’s Hashira
meeting, I, Amane Ubuyashiki, will represent

declining health.",Amane,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,

that his flame of life continues to burn even one day longer. I also
pray that your spirit remains strong, Amane.",Himejima,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,
"My sincere gratitude to all the Hashira.
As you may have already heard,
now that a demon who can withstand
the sunlight has appeared, Muzan Kibutsuji will change
his aim and come for her so that he can overcome the sun, too.
A large-scale war is near. I
have received reports that during
the fight against
Upper Rank Four and Five, Kanroji…",Amane,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,
… and Tokitou…,Amane,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,

those marks to appear.",Amane,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,
Marks?,Kanroji,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,
"During
the Sengoku period, there were swordsmen of the First Breathing who had almost defeated
Muzan Kibutsuji. All of them manifested marks similar to a demon crest.
Shinazugawa    Huh?",Amane,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,
"You may have heard such tales, but the tales are true.
Shinazugawa    This is the first I’ve heard of it. Why was it kept in the dark?",Amane,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,
"Many people
have tormented themselves over the marks
that did not manifest. That is
because there is a lack of clarity regarding the legend of the marks.
It could be because
it was not considered important at the time,
or perhaps, because
the Demon Slayer Corps has been nearly destroyed many times, the
information was not passed down. Only one thing was written down clearly.
When the marked one appears, the mark will appear on others around
as well as if in resonance.",Amane,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,
That was written down in the journal of the swordsman of the First Breathing.,Kiriya,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,
"The first
person in this generation who did manifest
the mark… was not a Hashira but Tanjirou Kamado. He was the first
marked one.",Amane,1,4,, At the Ubuyashiki residence. The Hashira have gathered.,1,,,,
"It was like “gwaaah”! And then “gaaah!”
My stomach was like “groooar”! Like that!",Tanjirou,1,4,," In a courtyard. Tanjirou
explains the feeling
of the mark manifesting to a kasugai
crow.",1,,,,
"However,
he did not seem to know how the mark manifested, so we put it aside for the time being. And this time, following
him, two Hashira have had this awakening.
Please teach us how to manifest
it, Kanroji and Tokitou.",Amane,1,4,," In a courtyard. Tanjirou
explains the feeling
of the mark manifesting to a kasugai
crow.",1,,,,
"Oh! S-Sure!
Lady Amane is so admirable! Mmm~!
Ah! Uh, well,
so at that time… if I remember
right, my body became very light.
Um… Uh… And then… it was… Ah!
It was like “gwaaah”! And “whooom”! Then “gaaah”! My heart was thumping nonstop!
My ears rang so loudly! Crack, crack, crack! Like that!
Shinazugawa    Huh?",Kanroji,1,4,Thoughts," In a courtyard. Tanjirou
explains the feeling
of the mark manifesting to a kasugai
crow.",1,,,,
My deepest apologies. I would crawl into a hole if there was one!,Kanroji,1,4,," In a courtyard. Tanjirou
explains the feeling
of the mark manifesting to a kasugai
crow.",1,,,,
"Okay, it’s my turn.",Tokitou,1,4,," In a courtyard. Tanjirou
explains the feeling
of the mark manifesting to a kasugai
crow.",1,,,,
Wahh…,Kanroji,1,4,," In a courtyard. Tanjirou
explains the feeling
of the mark manifesting to a kasugai
crow.",1,,,,
"I
wasn’t aware of any mark that manifested on me, but when I think back to that battle, there are a few unusual
things that come to mind. If the conditions are met, everyone could probably
manifest the mark.
I’ll tell you how I
did it.",Tokitou,1,4,," In a courtyard. Tanjirou
explains the feeling
of the mark manifesting to a kasugai
crow.",1,,,,
"During that battle, I was poisoned
and couldn’t move.
When I tried to slow down my blood circulation and the spread of the poison using my
breathing, I saw the boy who wanted to save me nearly killed, my lost memories
returned, and then I couldn’t control my emotions because I was so angry. I
think my heart rate was over 200 beats per minute.",Tokitou,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"Furthermore, my body was burning hot. My temperature must have reached
over 39 degrees Celsius.",Tokitou,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
Ah… How could you move in such a state? It could be life-threatening.,Shinobu,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"You’re right. It was like being sieved.
I think the difference between those who manifest the mark and those who don’t
is whether you die or not.",Tokitou,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"A heart rate over 200 beats per minute…
How can you be sure your temperature was 39 degrees?",Amane,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"Well,
I had a fever when I was being treated at Kochou’s place. The thermometer
showed my body temperature was 39 degrees.
I felt it was the same heat when the mark
manifested.",Tokitou,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"I didn’t realize
that.
Shinazugawa    Tsk… So it’s really that simple.",Kanroji,1,4,Thoughts," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"I envy you for being such a simpleton that you can call that simple.
Shinazugawa    What
did you say?",Tomioka,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
Nothing.,Tomioka,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"That means we Hashira
must manifest the mark.",Shinobu,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"Agreed. We will do something about
it. Please tell the Master
to rest assured.",Himejima,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"Thank you. But there is one thing I must tell you regarding
the training to manifest the mark.",Amane,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"Those who have manifested the mark will have no choice anymore.
They, without exception, will…",Amane,1,4,," In the Ubuyashiki residence. Tokitou explains
his circumstances.",1,,,,
"I understand now. But in that case, what would happen
to me? Good Lord.",Himejima,1,4,," Sometime later.
The rain has stopped. Amane,
Nichika, and Kiriya
have left the room.",1,,,,
"Since Lady Amane has left, I have nothing
left to do
here.
Shinazugawa    Hey,
hold on! Don’t just leave! We have to decide
what each of us is going to do.",Tomioka,1,4,," Sometime later.
The rain has stopped. Amane,
Nichika, and Kiriya
have left the room.",1,,,,
"The six of you can talk among yourselves. It has nothing
to do with me.",Tomioka,1,4,," Sometime later.
The rain has stopped. Amane,
Nichika, and Kiriya
have left the room.",1,,,,
"What do you mean by that?
You’re not aware enough that you’re a Hashira.
Or what? Do you want to start your training as soon as possible? You want to skip the meeting?
Shinazugawa    Wait,
you bastard!",Iguro,1,4,," Sometime later.
The rain has stopped. Amane,
Nichika, and Kiriya
have left the room.",1,,,,
"Explain yourself, Tomioka. You didn’t explain
enough.",Shinobu,1,4,," Sometime later.
The rain has stopped. Amane,
Nichika, and Kiriya
have left the room.",1,,,,
"I’m different from all of you.
Shinazugawa    I don’t like it. You said the same thing
before, Tomioka. Are you looking
down on us?",Tomioka,1,4,," Sometime later.
The rain has stopped. Amane,
Nichika, and Kiriya
have left the room.",1,,,,
"P-Please, don’t
fight! Stay calm,
okay?
Shinazugawa    Come
back here!",Kanroji,1,4,," Sometime later.

don’t!",Kanroji,1,4,," Sometime later.

this opportunity to strengthen the
entire Corps.

is Tokitou’s high-speed movement training. He’ll

training to improve
swordsmanship. I tell you the Serpent Hashira
is stubborn. After is Shinazugawa’s training.
I heard it’s endless striking
training, which, as I’m sure the name implies, will have no
end.
The last one is Himejima’s muscle strengthening. You have to throw away your humanity for this one.
The Hashira
are also expected
to improve their strength as well since they have to deal with the Corps members one after
another.

"Let’s say there’s someone
who’s all alone.
How would you go about telling that person
that they’re not alone in a way that would get through to that person?",Tanjirou,2,4,," In the morning, at the Butterfly
Mansion. Aoi sweeps
the ground in the courtyard. Tanjirou comes outside.",1,,,,
"Well,
I wouldn’t know the answer to that, but Mr. Tanjirou, you’re hoping to cheer that person up, right?
If it were me, I’d want you to let me be. Are you leaving now?",Aoi,2,4,," In the morning, at the Butterfly
Mansion. Aoi sweeps
the ground in the courtyard. Tanjirou comes outside.",1,,,,
"Oh, yes.",Tanjirou,2,4,," In the morning, at the Butterfly
Mansion. Aoi sweeps

"Could you wait a minute, please?",Aoi,2,4,," In the morning, at the Butterfly
Mansion. Aoi sweeps

"Oh… This person you’re
going to see… It’s just one, right?",Aoi,2,4,," In the morning, at the Butterfly
Mansion. Aoi sweeps
the ground in the courtyard. Tanjirou comes outside.",1,,,,
Hmm… This sure is complicated…,Tanjirou,2,4,," In the morning, at the Butterfly
Mansion. Aoi sweeps
the ground in the courtyard. Tanjirou comes outside.",1,,,,
"They’re very simple, but I made you some rice balls. For you and that person.
Whatever you do,
you need to eat your fill first, or
you can never become healthy
in body and soul.",Aoi,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"Ms. Aoi… Thank you!
I’ll be on my way!",Tanjirou,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"Excuse me! Mr. Tomioka!
Hello! Sorry to bother you!
Mr. Giyuu! It’s me! Are you around?
It’s Tanjirou Kamado! Hello!
All right, I’m coming in!",Tanjirou,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"Coming in? No, he must’ve
said he’s leaving.
I misheard him.",Tomioka,2,4,Thoughts," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"So, long story short, everyone’s been training!",Tanjirou,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
I know.,Tomioka,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
What? So you knew? I’m glad to hear it!,Tanjirou,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
Too close…,Tomioka,2,4,Thoughts," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"I’ll be cleared for active duty in seven
days’ time, so do you think you could train
me?",Tanjirou,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
That’s a no.,Tomioka,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"But why not?
I’m catching a faint whiff of anger… but what are you mad about?",Tanjirou,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"I’m angry that you didn’t master
Water Breathing to perfection.
You were supposed to become the Water Hashira.",Tomioka,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"I’m very sorry about that. But I did talk about it
with Mr. Urokodaki, and changing the style
you start out using to develop a new breathing technique isn’t all that
uncommon.
And as the Water Breathing moves are particularly in line with the fundamentals, he says
it’s spawned a lot of techniques.",Tanjirou,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"That’s not what I’m talking about.
Right now, in the absence
of a Water Hashira,
someone has to assume the mantle of Water Hashira sooner rather than later.",Tomioka,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
"In the absence of a Water
Hashira? But we have you, Mr. Giyuu.",Tanjirou,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle
of rice balls out for Tanjirou.",1,,,,
I am… not the Water Hashira.,Tomioka,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle

Get out of here.,Tomioka,2,4,," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle

to speak with him?”",Kagaya,2,4,Flashback," Sometime
later. Aoi holds a bundle

"Mr. Giyuu! I’ve brought
some rice balls with me! Would you like to have them with me?
They say that you can’t be in a bad mood on a full
stomach.
All right, I’m going
to leave them
here.",Tanjirou,2,4,," In the evening. Tanjirou
stands outside of Tomioka’s room.",1,,,,
"Mr. Giyuu! Good morning!
So, you’ve had those rice balls!
I’m glad to see that.",Tanjirou,2,4,," At dawn. Tomioka returns
to his house and finds
Tanjirou on the floor.",1,,,,
Ah… Mr. Giyuu!,Tanjirou,2,4,," At dawn. Tomioka returns
to his house and finds
Tanjirou on the floor.",1,,,,
"Mr. Giyuu! What’s going on, Mr. Giyuu?
Mr. Giyuu! What’s the problem? Are you on patrol?
It seems like there have been fewer demon sightings lately,
right?
No demons here, huh? Thank goodness! All right, let’s do some training now!",Tanjirou,2,4,," At dawn. Tomioka returns
to his house and finds
Tanjirou on the floor.",1,,,,
"Mr. Giyuu! Won’t you join us in training? Training!
Everyone’s waiting for you! Mr. Giyuu!",Tanjirou,2,4,," Later in the morning.
Tanjirou stands outside
Tomioka’s room.",1,,,,
"Mr. Giyuu. Mr. Giyuu! Mr. Giyuu? Mr. Giyuu!
Mr. Giyuu!",Tanjirou,2,4,," Throughout the day. Tanjirou
continues to bother
Tomioka.",1,,,,
"Is he going to… keep this up for the rest of my life? (Thoughts) If I talk to him, will he
stop stalking me?",Tomioka,2,4,Thoughts," Throughout the day. Tanjirou
continues to bother
Tomioka.",1,,,,
I… never passed the Final Selection.,Tomioka,2,4,," Sometime later,
in the mountains. Tanjirou continues to follow Tomioka.",1,,,,
"What? Final Selection? You mean the trail on the mountain
with wisteria flowers?",Tanjirou,2,4,," Sometime later,
in the mountains. Tanjirou continues to follow Tomioka.",1,,,,
"That’s right.
That year, along
with a boy whose family had also been killed
by demons, a boy with peach-colored hair named
Sabito, I took part in the Selection.",Tomioka,2,4,," Sometime later,
in the mountains. Tanjirou continues to follow Tomioka.",1,,,,
Sabito and Mr. Giyuu…,Tanjirou,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"Everyone but Sabito passed
that Final Seleciton.
I was… wounded by the first demon that attacked me and was in a daze.",Tomioka,2,4,," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"At that moment… it was Sabito who
saved me, too. Sabito     (Flashback) Water Breathing, Fourth Form… Striking
Tide! Demon       (Flashback)
Ahh!
Y.Tomioka       (Flashback) Ah…
Ugh…",Tomioka,2,4,," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
Eek… Ah… Ahhh!,Boy,2,4,Flashback," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"Leaving me in the care of another boy, Sabito ran off toward the voice pleading for help.
When I came to, the Final Selection was over.
It’s true that
I’d survived for seven days and passed the Selection, but as I’d failed to
defeat a single demon and had only been saved by another,
could you really
say that I’d passed?
I’m not worthy of being the Water Hashira.
And for that matter,
I’m not even worthy of standing as an equal with the other Hashira. I’m not like them. Normally,
there’d be no place for me in the Demon Slayer Corps.
Have the Hashira
train you. That would be best.
I’ll never manifest a mark. Though it might
have happened for Sabito.
Just forget about me from now on. You’re only wasting your time.",Tomioka,2,4,," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"I’ll bet that Mr. Giyuu
thinks he should’ve been the one to die.
I
know all too well how that feels. When someone close to you that you wish had outlived
you… ends up dying before
you instead, and worse, dies protecting you… it
leaves you feeling gutted with pain.
Sabito,
the boy who trained me on Mt. Sagiri… That was such a strange experience. They were both already
long dead, but they helped me.
I see. So, Sabito went through the Final Selection
with Mr. Giyuu? (Thoughts) If he’d lived, he
would’ve been the same age as Mr. Giyuu.
That’s
amazing… So amazing.
He saved everyone
during the Selection. (Thoughts) It’s something I
couldn’t do. It was all I could do to protect myself.
If Sabito
were alive now, he would’ve
become such an incredible swordsman.
That must be part of the reason
why Mr. Giyuu feels he should’ve been the
one to die.
I get that.
I had that same thought
myself.
Mr. Rengoku… risked
his own life to protect
us. He was an incredible man. (Thoughts) He was kinder than anyone else and stronger.
What
an amazing way to live… right up to the end. (Thoughts) I wished I’d been the one to die instead
of Mr. Rengoku.
I thought
Mr. Rengoku might’ve
been the one to kill Muzan one day. But…",Tanjirou,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"He said he believes in you, so just think about how you’re going to measure up to that!",Inosuke,2,4,Flashback," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"Right. Yes, that’s
right.
Absolutely! But what should
I say to Mr. Giyuu?
No
matter how pathetic and embarrassed you may feel, you’ve got to go on living.
Though he refuses to acknowledge it himself, I can imagine how hard he must’ve
driven himself, whipped
himself into shape
to become a Hashira. Just how much suffering
he must’ve gone through…
It’s not my place to criticize Mr. Giyuu when I know nothing about
him. But… But there’s one
thing that I just have to ask him.",Tanjirou,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"M-Mr. Giyuu!
Ugh, he won’t stop for
me!
Mr. Giyuu… Mr. Giyuu… Aren’t you going to pass on what Sabito
entrusted to you?
Y.Tomioka       (Flashback) S-Sabito?",Tanjirou,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"Don’t
ever say you should’ve died again!
Next time you say it, you and I are through! I won’t be your friend
anymore!
Your big sister,
who was supposed to be married the next
day, knew what was going to happen when she hid you from the demons to
protect you! You, of all people, shouldn’t be insulting your sister’s memory!
Don’t you dare die, no matter what! The life that your sister saved for you by
sacrificing her own… the future that she entrusted to you… You have to pass
those on, too, Giyuu!",Sabito,2,4,Flashback," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"It hurts.
The shock and pain that I felt when he struck me across the face is coming
back to me now so vividly.
Why did I forget it?
That conversation with Sabito…
Y.Tomioka       (Flashback) Ngh…",Tomioka,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"… was important, wasn’t it?
Y.Tomioka       (Flashback) Ahh…",Tomioka,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"I didn’t want to remember
it because I wouldn’t be able to stop the tears.
Y.Tomioka       (Flashback) Ngh… Ugh… Ngh…",Tomioka,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"Remembering made my grief unbearable, and it left me utterly
helpless.
Y.Tomioka       (Flashback) Ahhh!",Tomioka,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"Big Sis Tsutako…
Sabito… Sorry that I’m so immature.",Tomioka,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"Uh-oh… Now he’s standing stock-still.
What should I do? Was that harsh of me? Mr. Giyuu seemed
pretty down already, so did I
make it worse?
I know! How about a speed eating contest?
If I win the contest,
I’ll say, “Let’s
cheer up and get
some training in,” or something.
Since
I haven’t been cleared for active duty yet, it’s not like I can spar with him or anything… and Mr. Giyuu may be a man of few words,
but he wouldn’t have to talk during a speed eating contest! What a
brilliant idea!",Tanjirou,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"Tanjirou… It’s a little
late, but I’ll join the in the training --",Tomioka,2,4,," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
Mr. Giyuu! Wanna take me on in a cold soba noodle speed eating contest?,Tanjirou,2,4,," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
Why?,Tomioka,2,4,Thoughts," In the mountains. Tanjirou
processes Tomioka’s words.",1,,,,
"Listen, about the training
program, I didn’t
hear any mention
of Kochou. What’s
Kochou teaching you all?",Tomioka,2,4,," Sometime later,
in the city. Tanjirou and Tomioka have a speed eating contest.",1,,,,
"Ms. Shinobu?
Come to think of it, I haven’t heard anything. I wonder how she is.",Tanjirou,2,4,," Sometime later,
in the city. Tanjirou and Tomioka have a speed eating contest.",1,,,,
"Calm down. It’s all right.
Big Sis… Help me calm
down.
Only the immature
fail to control
their emotions. The immature…",Shinobu,2,4,Thoughts, At Shinobu’s house. Shinobu sits in her room in front of an altar.,1,,,,

I’m leaving now to be trained
by the Wind Hashira.",Kanao,2,4,, At Shinobu’s house. Shinobu sits in her room in front of an altar.,1,,,,
"Can your training session wait
until after the Stone Hashira’s? Shinobu         I won’t be able to take part in the Hashira
Training this time around.
Kanao      What? B-But why?",Kanao,2,4,, At Shinobu’s house. Shinobu sits in her room in front of an altar.,1,,,,
"Kanao, come over here.",Shinobu,2,4,, At Shinobu’s house. Shinobu sits in her room in front of an altar.,1,,,,
"Um… Um… I want to train with you more, Master.
I can see you’ve learned
to be much more candid about
voicing your feelings. That’s a
good sign.
Just as I thought,
the timing is just right.
I’d like to tell you… about
the demon who killed my older sister,
Kanae.",Kanao,2,4,, At Shinobu’s house. Shinobu sits in her room in front of an altar.,1,,,,

me. (Flashback) If I then take part in the Hashira Training, you’ll be
satisfied, right?",Tomioka,3,4,Flashback," In the past, at a restaurant. Tanjirou
and Tomioka have their soba eating competition.",1,,,,
"Yes! That would
make me happy!",Tanjirou,3,4,Flashback," In the past, at a restaurant. Tanjirou
and Tomioka have their soba eating competition.",1,,,,
"Then finish every last noodle.
I’m sure… Mr. Giyuu can still go on eating!
Even so… I’m bursting! I’m bursting! I’m bursting!!",Tomioka,3,4,Past Thoughts," In the past, at a restaurant. Tanjirou
and Tomioka have their soba eating competition.",1,,,,
"I got here late.
Shinazugawa    I only just got here myself.
So? How’s your training
going?",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,
"Never in a million
years could I see them as becoming
assets against an Upper Rank.
Shinazugawa    Haa… You could
say the same about mine.",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,
"However, training
the Corps members
is what the Master wants.
Shinazugawa    Yeah.",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,
"So, what did you want at
this hour? Shinazugawa        Tsk…
It’s been bugging me all this time. Iguro      You mean what happened
at that castle?
Shinazugawa    You and I drove
the demons to the brink
together. But then, they all vanished
somewhere.",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,
"Right. That many of them disappeared without a trace in a flash.
Shinazugawa    Yeah.",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,
"I’ve been pondering myself
ever since that day… what could be behind that door. That there might actually be a demon
hideout we don’t know about.
Shinazugawa    A hideout,
huh? Since that day, I’ve looked into that castle
numerous times only to come up empty.",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,
"Right around
that time, the demons all vanished from the cities at once.
Shinazugawa    So, they’re after Kamado’s little
sister, after all?",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,
"No doubt about that,
I’m sure. Something huge might be about to start.
Shinazugawa    Hmph…
Whatever starts, I’ll be happy
to bring it all to an end!",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,
"Don’t you think this might be a bad omen for the Demon
Slayer Corps?
So long as I’m training the Corps members,
it keeps me distracted. But I look at the
situation with a dispassionate eye, and I can’t help being aware of what’s to
come.
That this stillness… might be the harbinger of a storm.
Shinazugawa    Going
on and on about it now isn’t going to get us anywhere.",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,
"I do have a proposal for you.
Shinazugawa    Heh… And I happen to have one for you, too. Mind if I tell you mine first?
Take me on in a match!",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,
"What a coincidence. That’s
just what I was going to propose.",Iguro,3,4,," In the evening.
Iguro finds Shinazugawa.",1,,,,

And I’m replacing
it with a special drill that’s close to actual
combat! Head to the mountain!",Uzui,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
"Battles with demons always happen at night.
That’s why we have to hone our combat skills in the dark.
Strain to see in the dark, and what you can’t see
you’ll just have to sense! Starting now, I’m a demon.
I’m a demon that’s
going to devour
you. Let’s see you try to survive somehow.
And Kamado, your job is to bring
me down while protecting the rest of these guys!
Ah… Ngh… Ah…
Hey! Here he comes!
He’s nearby!",Uzui,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
"Ugh! Gah!
Ngh… Ugh! Gah!
Guh… Eek!
I can’t see a thing!
Mr. Uzui

for his presence
by smell!
Where

"I-Impossible… A-Against
a Hashira, we don’t stand
a chance!",Slayer,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
Would you say the same thing to a demon?,Uzui,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
Huh? Erk!,Slayer,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
"Mr.
Uzui is a former Hashria, so if we hit him with any half-hearted attacks, he’ll see right through them all!
Stay together!
Everyone, come close to me, stand
back to back, and don’t leave yourselves open in any way!",Tanjirou,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
"Too slow!
Too slow! Way too slow!",Uzui,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
"Hey, not bad, Kamado.",Uzui,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
"His strength with just one hand… That’s
Mr. Uzui for
you!",Tanjirou,3,4,Thoughts, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
"Come on now! Come at me
again!",Uzui,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
"A-Amazing…
He’s holding his own against a former Hashira!",Slayers,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
"This is… an exchange
of blows between
two people who fought an Upper Rank and
survived.",Slayer,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,
"You sure took your skills
to the next level… Kamado!",Uzui,3,4,Thoughts, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,

starting to look
good!",Uzui,3,4,, In the late evening. Uzui gathers the Demon Slayers.,1,,,,

you let a retired guy like me clobber you like this?
Haa… Jeez, can’t you even show me some bravado?",Uzui,3,4,," Sometime
later. Uzui finishes
beating the Demon Slayers.",1,,,,
We don’t stand a chance.,Slayer,3,4,," Sometime

later. Uzui finishes
beating the Demon Slayers.",1,,,,
"The Hashira and Kamado
might be able to defeat the Upper Ranks and Muzan Kibutsuji!
This has given me that hope! Me, too!

you! We’re going to train and get stronger!
We’re going to get stronger!",Slayers,3,4,," Sometime

Get lost, will you?

you mind holding
this?",Tokitou,4,4,," At Tokitou’s training

The Master?,Tanjirou,4,4,," At Tokitou’s training
area. Tokitou scolds

swords.

"You’ll never be a match for your opponent
if you attack emotionally, all right? More like a moth flying into a flame, actually.
There are no do-overs
when you battle a demon.
Even if you’re 9-1, that
one loss could be fatal.
You need to hone every one of your movements to gain the skills that will help you survive.",Tokitou,4,4,, In the late afternoon. Tokitou’s training continues. Tokitou knocks a wooden sword out of a Demon Slayer’s hands.,1,,,,
"Let’s call it a day, then.

to ease up a little
with the drills? If this keeps up, we’re gonna
collapse before we ever take on a demon.",Slayers,4,4,, In the late afternoon. Tokitou’s training continues. Tokitou knocks a wooden sword out of a Demon Slayer’s hands.,1,,,,
"Hmm… But… I think this must be
hardest on Tokitou
himself. He’s the one who’s been
training us nonstop on his own.",Tanjirou,4,4,, In the late afternoon. Tokitou’s training continues. Tokitou knocks a wooden sword out of a Demon Slayer’s hands.,1,,,,
You have a point there.,Slayer,4,4,, In the late afternoon. Tokitou’s training continues. Tokitou knocks a wooden sword out of a Demon Slayer’s hands.,1,,,,

Here’s a towel.,Slayer,4,4,," At the wash station. Tanjirou
rinses his face.",1,,,,
"It would be great
if he could at least
drop that tone with us.
It’s pretty
soul-crushing, isn’t it? Uh-huh!",Slayers,4,4,," At the wash station. Tanjirou
rinses his face.",1,,,,
"But to me, it seems like he’s actually
toned it down some compared
to before.
It’s hopeless.",Tanjirou,4,4,," At the wash station. Tanjirou
rinses his face.",1,,,,
"Tokitou?
I wonder where he’s
going.",Tanjirou,4,4,," At the wash station. Tanjirou
rinses his face.",1,,,,
"The Hashira always goes out somewhere
at nightfall.
He’s probably having dinner,
I guess.
Shinazugawa    Ugh…
Ngh…
Even…",Slayers,4,4,," At the wash station. Tanjirou
rinses his face.",1,,,,
… is what we seem to be.,Iguro,4,4,," At night, in an empty

Shinazugawa    You come all this way out here every day. That doesn’t
affect your daytime
training?",Iguro,4,4,," At night, in an empty
area. Shinazugawa and Iguro spar.",1,,,,
"It might suffice as training for the Corps members, but it’s not enough for me.
Shinazugawa    Heh…
Well, yeah. For us, this is the real Hashira
Training.",Tokitou,4,4,," At night, in an empty
area. Shinazugawa and Iguro spar.",1,,,,
"Right. It’s not fair, you know, leaving out the rest of us.",Tokitou,4,4,," At night, in an empty
area. Shinazugawa and Iguro spar.",1,,,,
"All right,
to show our respect for you, Tokitou,
Shinazugawa and I will take you on two
against one.",Iguro,4,4,," At night, in an empty
area. Shinazugawa and Iguro spar.",1,,,,
"Both of you? That’s
hardly fair. Ready when… you are!
Shinazugawa    Ngh!
Shinazugawa    Ngh…
Ugh!
Toki.Crow         Nice going! Just demolish
those two! You’re
so incredible!
Shinazugawa    Shut
up!
Toki.Crow         Gah!
Shinazugawa    Phew…
Today’s training hit hard again.
If we’d lost focus for even a second,
someone could’ve gotten hurt for real.",Tokitou,4,4,," At night, in an empty
area. Shinazugawa and Iguro spar.",1,,,,
"Well, otherwise, there’d be no point in training.
Shinazugawa    Taking on the Corps members by day, combat-style training with you guys by night…
Heh… Not bad at all.",Iguro,4,4,," Sometime
later. Tokitou, Shinazugawa, and Iguro end their spar.",1,,,,

training going?",Iguro,4,4,," Sometime

Shinazugawa    That
guy? Talk about stubbornly refusing
to die!",Tokitou,4,4,," Sometime
later. Tokitou, Shinazugawa, and Iguro end their spar.",1,,,,
"It looks
like his wounds
are healing up, and he’ll probably be fully recovered by the time he gets to your place, Mr. Iguro.",Tokitou,4,4,," Sometime
later. Tokitou, Shinazugawa, and Iguro end their spar.",1,,,,
"Is that right? Then,
that means I can be thorough with him, right?
Shinazugawa    Just because he got somewhat
stronger, it doesn’t
mean he’s anywhere
near a match for
a Hashira! We’ll show him!",Iguro,4,4,," Sometime
later. Tokitou, Shinazugawa, and Iguro end their spar.",1,,,,
"That sounds
like fun! Good luck,
Tanjirou!",Tokitou,4,4,," Sometime
later. Tokitou, Shinazugawa, and Iguro end their spar.",1,,,,

You, there… You’ve stopped

"You didn’t attack me blindly, which might be a sign of growth.",Tokitou,4,4,," In the morning,
at Tokitou’s training
area. Tokitou launches
toward a Demon Slayer.",1,,,,
"Ngh… I already know. Compared to you, I have no clue how grueling battles
can be.
Not only that, but I also know that you go somewhere every
night, and that underneath
your clothing, you’re all covered in bruises.
I’ve seen you cooling them off with water early
in the morning. We’re going to work hard to get better, so…",Slayer,4,4,," In the morning,
at Tokitou’s training
area. Tokitou launches
toward a Demon Slayer.",1,,,,
"I think you’re all doing as well as you can. But even so, that doesn’t mean you can win.
I don’t want you to get killed by a demon.
If possible, I want you to live long lives. That’s
how I really feel.",Tokitou,4,4,," In the morning,
at Tokitou’s training

toward a Demon Slayer.",1,,,,

more fluid.",Tokitou,4,4,," Several
days later. Tanjirou
trains with Tokitou.",1,,,,
"That’s
good! Yes, like that!
That way, your stamina will last longer.

"What are you going to do? Are you planning to kill Genya?!
Shinazugawa    Hell no. I’m not going to kill him.
It would be easy enough to kill him, but since
it’s against the rules and all…
I’m going to ruin him beyond
recovery! But listen,
if you quit the Demon
Slayer Corps right now, I’ll
let you go.",Tanjirou,5,4,," Sometime
later. Tanjirou heads to his rest chambers.",1,,,,
"Don’t give me that! There’s no way you have that kind of authority! Don’t
try to force him to quit!
You just said yourself
that you had no younger
brother, right? So no matter what choices Genya makes, you can’t butt in!
Whether he has the ability or not, he’s made up his mind to risk his life fighting demons!
If you’re
not his big brother, then I won’t let you get in his way, no matter what! Without Genya, we wouldn’t have defeated
that Upper Rank!
No way am I going to let you ruin him beyond recovery!
Shinazugawa    Is that right?
Then I’ll ruin you beyond recovery
first!",Tanjirou,5,4,," Sometime

got to be a better way to signal!",Zenitsu,5,4,," Sometime

me, but that kick ripped
my ear!

got some nerve,

later. Tanjirou makes rice balls for the group.",1,,,,
"Yeah, I think I get it now, too.
It’s too exhausting, so they must have all run off. Yeah.

his soul has been
crushed.",Slayers,6,4,," Sometime

either!
It’s been six days now! What am I going to do?
It’s not like the demons will stay inactive forever.

have enough muscular strength? Or could there be
another breathing technique?
Even after all this training,
I still can’t
maintain my mark!",Tanjirou,6,4,Thoughts," Sometime later.

if they’re looking at it every
day, they wouldn’t be able to spot the difference. Don’t you have a mirror?",Genya,6,4,," Sometime later.

"Aren’t you guys using
repetitive motion?",Genya,6,4,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou continues trying
to push the boulder.",1,,,,
"So you’re not, huh?
Well, not that Mr. Himejima
is exactly good at teaching
it. You need to watch and learn and swipe it for yourself, all
right?
To enhance
your concentration to the max, you perform
a predetermined action.
In my case, I chant the
nenbutsu.",Genya,6,4,," Sometime later.
Tanjirou continues trying

does, too!",Tanjirou,6,4,," Sometime later.

anyway.",Genya,6,4,," Sometime later.
Genya prepares to leave.",1,,,,
"One more time.
Repetitive motion. Remember what Genya told you.",Tanjirou,6,4,Thoughts," Sometime later.
Genya prepares to leave.",1,,,,
"You open up all of your senses
at once.
According to Mr. Himejima,
even though I can’t use breathing techniques, I can still move that boulder if I use repetitive motion.
Well, not that I’ve made much headway
yet.
When Mr. Himejima
and Genya use this, they revive their memories of being
angry and in pain. By doing that, they increase their heart rate and body
temperature!
Urahhh… Ahh… Ahh!",Genya,6,4,Thoughts," Sometime later.
Genya prepares to leave.",1,,,,
"Dammit! Still a long way to go, huh?
Can you make dinner now?

"It’s like working up your emotions, I guess.",Genya,6,4,," At night,
in the rest building. Genya
returns as Tanjirou
makes dinner.",1,,,,
"But… this is just a
thought. Isn’t the mark on your forehead
a sign that you’re in that same state?",Genya,6,4,," At night,
in the rest building. Genya
returns as Tanjirou
makes dinner.",1,,,,
"Yeah, but neither Mr. Himejima nor even you, Genya, have a mark.",Tanjirou,6,4,," At night,
